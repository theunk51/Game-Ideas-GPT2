o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.

o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?

nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game.

nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nw1p0j, Survive all family, Has anybody ever ask you if you were on a survival island who would you be with  Now you know  This clash of clans type game  Will be a 3-D game where you were put on an island in the mid evil times  There are a total of five medium size islands around you each of your family members will pick a side The goal is based on teamwork in survival no you do not have to fight your family members unless you want to  Basically there’s wildlife and sharks  The game will actually never end  It’s more like a Minecraft type style game but without the blocks  So your goal inside this game is to survive but you have endless life  Because the grown-up to make the game server well actually be adults  You have to put in an age that decides if your God or not  Now when the children are spawning in  There is a cut scene of a flying golden hair and putting you on the ground  Every time you die this will happen  So it takes place in mid evil times  There are also some natural disasters  Like tsunami‘s earthquakes tornadoes  And rain or thunderstorm  As the days go on your team a family members can build Farm eat or kill  Also the parents can cause natural disasters two but sometimes normally
nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?
nxiogt, Game Ideas, [removed]
numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.
nxgikz, Want to make an exploring game but have no ideas, The tittle sayd it all. If your idea makes it in thr game, I'll give you credit. Thanks!
o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs. The large creature swallows you by sucking you off and you disappear into a Black. You woke up into mass wetlands with lots of fungi  with large ivory trees  acting  as teeth trap you and this is where the journey begins.   The player has to find a way out of the  body of the effigy. It's inspired by the human body's anatomy and systems. It goes from the largest organs all the way to the smallest cells. As you explore you running into different people and enemies. You start to learn more about the effigy and try to uncover its secrets. Test various different environments. You'll be going through some that act like caves another act like jungle. You find different Beast and insects that will challenge you with what new entities inspired by cells and virus but into nature style. You will have to learn to survive in this new world. He said classified as came as adventure and action /survival/ metroidvania.  You will learn different skills and abilities that are similar and interested by fighter/rouge /bard/wizard/ cleric/monk/druid/ ranger classes in dnd/fastiny. There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5a1m1, Iam designing a game i call True Iron it follows a Robot that has no name humans have all been made to evacuate on Mars because of Robots that have made Earth theirs your sent out to kill every Human Being but they reprogram you in The End you have only two choices Kill The Robots or Kill The Humans, The Robots themselves havent done anything but The Leaders have These robots are just like Humans its a 2.5d N64 Polygon style No Man's Sky Kind of game but in 2D kind of like Adventure Of Link you can even get new weapons and fuse weapons there are also Metroidvania sections where you wander around Castles and buildings
o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.

o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?
ntodok, Wario's Waft Medical Analysis, 
nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game. A rust like experience where you start with nothing, can build your ship and with mordhau level combat and looting different islands and running away with your loot. But hardcore survival. ITD BE AMAZING
nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again

nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)
nwva2v, Hello colleagues! Here is my concept of a graphic adventure game.

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?

numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.

o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs. The large creature swallows you by sucking you off and you disappear into a Black. You woke up into mass wetlands with lots of fungi  with large ivory trees  acting  as teeth trap you and this is where the journey begins.   The player has to find a way out of the  body of the effigy. It's inspired by the human body's anatomy and systems. It goes from the largest organs all the way to the smallest cells. As you explore you running into different people and enemies. You start to learn more about the effigy and try to uncover its secrets. Test various different environments. You'll be going through some that act like caves another act like jungle. You find different Beast and insects that will challenge you with what new entities inspired by cells and virus but into nature style. You will have to learn to survive in this new world. He said classified as came as adventure and action /survival/ metroidvania.  You will learn different skills and abilities that are similar and interested by fighter/rouge /bard/wizard/ cleric/monk/druid/ ranger classes in dnd/fastiny. There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5a1m1, Iam designing a game i call True Iron it follows a Robot that has no name humans have all been made to evacuate on Mars because of Robots that have made Earth theirs your sent out to kill every Human Being but they reprogram you in The End you have only two choices Kill The Robots or Kill The Humans, The Robots themselves havent done anything but The Leaders have These robots are just like Humans its a 2.5d N64 Polygon style No Man's Sky Kind of game but in 2D kind of like Adventure Of Link you can even get new weapons and fuse weapons there are also Metroidvania sections where you wander around Castles and buildings
o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.
o1xsal, A game that simulates game collecting with a list of spoof titles based on real video games and consoles. Perhaps a budgeting game of some sort., [deleted]
o2slyk, Needs help in coding on my 3d pokemon open world game, So i am making a 3d pokemon game i am stuck in how can i switch screen from the normal view to the battlesystem can someone help me if you know any tutorials please do tell me it would be really nice of you
o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?

nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game.

nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nw1p0j, Survive all family, Has anybody ever ask you if you were on a survival island who would you be with  Now you know  This clash of clans type game  Will be a 3-D game where you were put on an island in the mid evil times  There are a total of five medium size islands around you each of your family members will pick a side The goal is based on teamwork in survival no you do not have to fight your family members unless you want to  Basically there’s wildlife and sharks  The game will actually never end  It’s more like a Minecraft type style game but without the blocks  So your goal inside this game is to survive but you have endless life  Because the grown-up to make the game server well actually be adults  You have to put in an age that decides if your God or not  Now when the children are spawning in  There is a cut scene of a flying golden hair and putting you on the ground  Every time you die this will happen  So it takes place in mid evil times  There are also some natural disasters  Like tsunami‘s earthquakes tornadoes  And rain or thunderstorm  As the days go on your team a family members can build Farm eat or kill  Also the parents can cause natural disasters two but sometimes normally
nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?
nxiogt, Game Ideas, [removed]
numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.
nxgikz, Want to make an exploring game but have no ideas, The tittle sayd it all. If your idea makes it in thr game, I'll give you credit. Thanks!
o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching.

nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5a1m1, Iam designing a game i call True Iron it follows a Robot that has no name humans have all been made to evacuate on Mars because of Robots that have made Earth theirs your sent out to kill every Human Being but they reprogram you in The End you have only two choices Kill The Robots or Kill The Humans, The Robots themselves havent done anything but The Leaders have These robots are just like Humans its a 2.5d N64 Polygon style No Man's Sky Kind of game but in 2D kind of like Adventure Of Link you can even get new weapons and fuse weapons there are also Metroidvania sections where you wander around Castles and buildings
o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

After a small fire fight, the retreating veitcong are found fleeing to a tunnel. Your sqaud leader tells you to drop your gear and hands you an anglehead flashlight and a 1911. You crawl through the darkness as the tunnel caves in behind you leaving you stranded from your platoon. Upon more exploration you find this tunnel leads to a vast network of underground muntions supplies, barraks and hospitals. With every gun shot you experience a breif deafness and prolonged ringing in your ears. With obsticals such as mines, posionous snakes, booby traps and veitcong soldiers hiding around every corner, your only goal now is to escape with your life.
nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.
o1xsal, A game that simulates game collecting with a list of spoof titles based on real video games and consoles. Perhaps a budgeting game of some sort., [deleted]

o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?
ntodok, Wario's Waft Medical Analysis, 
nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game. A rust like experience where you start with nothing, can build your ship and with mordhau level combat and looting different islands and running away with your loot. But hardcore survival.

nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nw1p0j, Survive all family, Has anybody ever ask you if you were on a survival island who would you be with  Now you know  This clash of clans type game  Will be a 3-D game where you were put on an island in the mid evil times  There are a total of five medium size islands around you each of your family members will pick a side The goal is based on teamwork in survival no you do not have to fight your family members unless you want to  Basically there’s wildlife and sharks  The game will actually never end  It’s more like a Minecraft type style game but without the blocks  So your goal inside this game is to survive but you have endless life  Because the grown-up to make the game server well actually be adults  You have to put in an age that decides if your God or not  Now when the children are spawning in  There is a cut scene of a flying golden hair and putting you on the ground  Every time you die this will happen  So it takes place in mid evil times  There are also some natural disasters  Like tsunami‘s earthquakes tornadoes  And rain or thunderstorm  As the days go on your team a family members can build Farm eat or kill  Also the parents can cause natural disasters two but sometimes normally
nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?
nxiogt, Game Ideas, [removed]
numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.
nxgikz, Want to make an exploring game but have no ideas, The tittle sayd it all. If your idea makes it in thr game, I'll give you credit. Thanks!
o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs. The large creature swallows you by sucking you off and you disappear into a Black. You woke up into mass wetlands with lots of fungi  with large ivory trees  acting  as teeth trap you and this is where the journey begins.   The player has to find a way out of the  body of the effigy. It's inspired by the human body's anatomy and systems. It goes from the largest organs all the way to the smallest cells. As you explore you running into different people and enemies. You start to learn more about the effigy and try to uncover its secrets. Test various different environments. You'll be going through some that act like caves another act like jungle. You find different Beast and insects that will challenge you with what new entities inspired by cells and virus but into nature style. You will have to learn to survive in this new world. He said classified as came as adventure and action /survival/ metroidvania.  You will learn different skills and abilities that are similar and interested by fighter/rouge /bard/wizard/ cleric/monk/druid/ ranger classes in dnd/fastiny. There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:
o563dz, 2D sandbox multiplayer platformer game, [removed]
o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?
oambnn, Unity C# MMORPG Development Live Stream, [removed]
oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.

o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?

nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!

The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nw1p0j, Survive all family, Has anybody ever ask you if you were on a survival island who would you be with  Now you know  This clash of clans type game  Will be a 3-D game where you were put on an island in the mid evil times  There are a total of five medium size islands around you each of your family members will pick a side The goal is based on teamwork in survival no you do not have to fight your family members unless you want to  Basically there’s wildlife and sharks  The game will actually never end  It’s more like a Minecraft type style game but without the blocks  So your goal inside this game is to survive but you have endless life  Because the grown-up to make the game server well actually be adults  You have to put in an age that decides if your God or not  Now when the children are spawning in  There is a cut scene of a flying golden hair and putting you on the ground  Every time you die this will happen  So it takes place in mid evil times  There are also some natural disasters  Like tsunami‘s earthquakes tornadoes  And rain or thunderstorm  As the days go on your team a family members can build Farm eat or kill  Also the parents can cause natural disasters two but sometimes normally
nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?
nxiogt, Game Ideas, [removed]
numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.
nxgikz, Want to make an exploring game but have no ideas, The tittle sayd it all. If your idea makes it in thr game, I'll give you credit. Thanks!
o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs. The large creature swallows you by sucking you off and you disappear into a Black. You woke up into mass wetlands with lots of fungi  with large ivory trees  acting  as teeth trap you and this is where the journey begins.   The player has to find a way out of the  body of the effigy. It's inspired by the human body's anatomy and systems. It goes from the largest organs all the way to the smallest cells. As you explore you running into different people and enemies. You start to learn more about the effigy and try to uncover its secrets. Test various different environments. You'll be going through some that act like caves another act like jungle. You find different Beast and insects that will challenge you with what new entities inspired by cells and virus but into nature style. You will have to learn to survive in this new world. He said classified as came as adventure and action /survival/ metroidvania.  You will learn different skills and abilities that are similar and interested by fighter/rouge /bard/wizard/ cleric/monk/druid/ ranger classes in dnd/fastiny. There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5a1m1, Iam designing a game i call True Iron it follows a Robot that has no name humans have all been made to evacuate on Mars because of Robots that have made Earth theirs your sent out to kill every Human Being but they reprogram you in The End you have only two choices Kill The Robots or Kill The Humans, The Robots themselves havent done anything but The Leaders have These robots are just like Humans its a 2.5d N64 Polygon style No Man's Sky Kind of game but in 2D kind of like Adventure Of Link you can even get new weapons and fuse weapons there are also Metroidvania sections where you wander around Castles and buildings
o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.

o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?

nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game.

nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again

nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community.

nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?

numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.

o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs. The large creature swallows you by sucking you off and you disappear into a Black. You woke up into mass wetlands with lots of fungi  with large ivory trees  acting  as teeth trap you and this is where the journey begins.   The player has to find a way out of the  body of the effigy. It's inspired by the human body's anatomy and systems. It goes from the largest organs all the way to the smallest cells. As you explore you running into different people and enemies. You start to learn more about the effigy and try to uncover its secrets. Test various different environments. You'll be going through some that act like caves another act like jungle. You find different Beast and insects that will challenge you with what new entities inspired by cells and virus but into nature style. You will have to learn to survive in this new world. He said classified as came as adventure and action /survival/ metroidvania.  You will learn different skills and abilities that are similar and interested by fighter/rouge /bard/wizard/ cleric/monk/druid/ ranger classes in dnd/fastiny. There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.   Main Characters: ÉskýÉský(eh-ski) is a free-spirited, friendly, and mutated gray wolf who wishes to live a peaceful life in a clean world. Exúda (ex-yoo-da)is a bipedal, stalwart, and mutant black bear.  Missions:  Attack on Animal TestersIt’s a terrifying thing to confront yourabusers. Sometimes, to overcome fear, the best course of action is to face your demons. Will you head for the animal testing labs and face them? The player must go to 3 testing labs. Éskýwas tested at one, Exúdaat the second, and Návíthaat the third.Mutated humans inside and outside of the facilities are difficult to take down, so Exúdais recommended for this mission. However, Éskýand Návíthacan lures the humans to explosive substances and bait them into hitting the substances and causing an explosion that kills them. The player must run away before the explosions occur so that they do not take damage.   Bizarre ZooRumorhasit that there’s a zoo by the sea where all of its animals are forced to perform as if they were members of a huge circus. Uncover the zoo’s whereabouts and stop the abuse by freeing the animals!  There are many more missions I am working on. Has anyone seen/played such a game? Do you think this would work? Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
o0agne, Kerbal Space Program, but multiplayer and in VR, As the title suggests, it's like Kerbal Space Program, except you have to work together and it's in VR.     You work with teammates to travel to other planets or launch sattelites into space.   You can work together on 1 ship or all make seperate ships.     Of course there'd be 0 gravity meaning no restrictions in movement.

o1i3fw, So me and my brother are game designers and were trying to get ideas but we can't think of anything all that we could think of was either a Multiplayer fps, looter shooter, or survival game what do you think and if you have any ideas it would be very helpful, 
nyzqkg, Trying to create a unique MOBA, I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.  **A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.  **The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG.
o1xsal, A game that simulates game collecting with a list of spoof titles based on real video games and consoles. Perhaps a budgeting game of some sort., [deleted]
o2slyk, Needs help in coding on my 3d pokemon open world game, So i am making a 3d pokemon game i am stuck in how can i switch screen from the normal view to the battlesystem can someone help me if you know any tutorials please do tell me it would be really nice of you
o2vu7d, Anti-peta beat em up, The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a "shelter", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan.

nzczp6, An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines., Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.  The life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.  Then you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.  So for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features.   And with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.  And you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.  I've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.  &amp;#x200B;  There are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!
o106rq, Certain Period Sim inside a Sim., Not sure if original idea  E.g. Cities Skyline.  The game will record player playtime in normal/original mode of Cities Skyline. Like, "game time" between year2007 to year2021, complete with all the proggression throughout that period.  After that. A "living mode" will be hosted, consisting above timeline starting from the beginning which is year2007, where up to 500 player can join the game. Time goes slower in this sim mode. They must survive financially.
o13knq, A crypto currency game that can actually work., There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.  The core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.  &amp;#x200B;  So what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.  &amp;#x200B;  *That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.  Then to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.  Yes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.  &amp;#x200B;  **See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**  By using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.  Now players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.  &amp;#x200B;  How do the developers make money from this:  By selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.  &amp;#x200B;  For this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.  In short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.  The developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash.
np6kof, A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game, Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?  Well, I have an idea.  &amp;#x200B;  Up to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.  The **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.  The **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:  1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.  2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.  3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)  4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.  The technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.  The **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role.   1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.  2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain "Injuries". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.  3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.  4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get "Angry" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time.   5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.  6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.  The **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.  1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.  2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time.
nzbwnw, Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights), First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."  The game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.  I am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game.
nzuju2, want to make a porn parody of resident evil 8 want to get idea, also im gonna call my game resident evil milf
o0v318, Game idea, TL;DR: Its A Legend of Zelda Game, that is Breath of the Wild Meets Ocarina of Time, Meets A DooM That is 50% DooM 2016/4 &amp; DooM Eternal ,50% Dooms I &amp; II, with the astytetc meeting the Evil Dead  Im currently being inspired by one thought of the leader of the deadites from The Evil Dead to make a Doom-Like game, complete with no reloading, lots of weapons, movement as your **SOLE** defense, and of course: **GLORY KILLS**, amoung other things set in the universe (Or more likely set in a universe SIMILAR, POSSIBLY to the point of having the freedom to use some material **FROM** The Evil Dead TO) of The Evil Dead  Im going to go over each of the aspects of the game that I aspire to make  # STORY  now I will try to make my universe as seperate from The Evil Dead series as possible while still being faithful to the universe, for example Im going to have a God of evil that is the creator AND the leader of the Deadites (will possibly come up with a different enough name for them) along side other gods and goddesses who Im not CERTANT yet on HOW exactly they will play in the story but they will, and the protagionst being a female doomslayer in the since that she is the female embodyment of doomslayers brutality, BUT im still thinking of HOW I can incorprate a tone that is 50% 1990s action shooter, 50% The Evil Dead I and Medevil Dead (aka armies of Darkness)  # GAMEPLAY  like I mentioned above it will be part Breath of the Wild, Part Ocarina of TIme, with a DASH of A link between worlds/a link to the past (mostly for the map size and layout), BUT the biggest aspects will be that its LoZ meets DooM, so it will be MUCH more action focused and **MUCH** more fast paced, with me wanting to include things like: Weapons from project brutality, movement as your sole defense, **GLORY KILLS**, ect.  # DESIGN   Im debating on if I should look for another artstyle for this kind of game or if I should stick to my favie (favorite) artstyle of anime.  # CONTROLS   It will basiclly be a combination of DooM and LoZ  # MUSIC/OST  Now this one Im dreaming of making my own Metal keyboard thingy for FL Studio so that I can make REAL, Like Mick Gorden-**ESK** (this means not like Mick Gorden but VERY MUCH LIKE HIM) metal music with FL Studio, but other than that ill try to this of this too  &amp;#x200B;  and that is basiclly it for my Idea, if you like give me some feedback (like on how to simplify some ~~all since im a beginner~~ aspects of my game) or Ideas
o13bg7, Looking for a 3d multiplayer game, 
norvmt, pine cone collecting simulator, a death road to canada parody., so this game is a sequel to death road to canada, you play as a gun obsessed zombie apocalypse survivor who made his way through the gate, and now you collect pine cones for a living.  the game has the same controls and graphics as death road to canada (possibly a mod) and you wander around canada collecting pinecones, exchanging them for loonies.  you can use loonies to buy supplies, like bullets to shoot meese for food, or medical supplies if you get a really bat splinter.  no i'm not drunk. yes i have questionable sanity.
nou6jl, A game where you play as The Guy from Disturbed., A souls like game where we play as "[The Guy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oidarcn/images/d/dc/Theguy_I.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151027014434)" from the band Disturbed. Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness.
nq71i6, Pocket town, A vague idea where the player uses a set of 1-3 interchangeable mini towns/villages of varying types and styles to fight other npcs/players in several formats such as direct combat with units or some other objective.  The Player could have full customization over the towns such as layout and placement of buildings and what races, and functions they perform and be animated.  Using the placement of buildings, the types of buildings and produce the player could produce different effects in battle \*like combined attacks, WMDs etc  This is just a vague idea and could be extended.

nrjd98, Suggestions for my game idea? :D, Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/  (The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)  Here's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in "camera mode" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.  Anways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)
nsdy59, 2D Mars split screen pvp game, I want to create a game set on Mars that will be splitscreen/shared screen and have terrain like noita where each pixel is simulated. Basically like terraria but with very very small blocks. Right now I am thinking maybe each player crashes on the planet and it is a race to the hollow core of the world to gather the final material needed to repair your ship. You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.
nqeljy, Harvesting a planet's resources gives you special abilties, You're a small alien monster that has to crash land on a nearby planet. This planet is hyper rich in resources so you start collecting everything in sight. Rocks, trees, gems, and animals. Everything you harvest is consumed and instantly converted to experience points. Spend experience on abilities that make things easier to do. Move faster, harvest faster, harvest better. Upgrades are represented visually.   As you uncover the map, you discover parts from your ship. Find parts, repair them, bring them back to your ship. Each ship part requires 1 special item that is earned by defeating bosses or solving puzzles.
nqczze, A rogue-like or -lite that becomes multiplayer after a winning run, In order to play multiplayer you must do so with a character or team of characters with which you have completed the short rogue like single player campaign. Your character(s) can be permanently lost with repeated multiplayer losses and you must win with a new character to compete again. Thoughts?
ntodok, Wario's Waft Medical Analysis, 
nu2d7d, Crossing Beringia: survival/crafting, but you're always on the move, This idea is sort of the opposite of Oregon Trail: you're the first peoples moving into the Americas over the land bridge that will someday be the Bearing Strait, about 20,000 years ago.  I had this idea because I *love* wandering around in Breath of the Wild, hunting and gathering, killing the occasional megafauna, and I wish the map would go on and on, without any goal other than seeing the terrain gradually change from one type of biome to another. I don't know how many other people would be into this, but it would be immensely satisfying to just wander generally southward with a tribe, hunting to keep our stamina up, crafting clothes, housing, and weapons, looking for a gap in the ice sheet, and seeing the landscape gradually change. That provides a lot of opportunity to learn real history through the game, hence the allusion to Oregon Trail.  The difference from Oregon Trail (other than the obvious difference in era and historical situation), is that I'm imagining Breath of the Wild-style game mechanics. (Disclosure: BotW is my first 3D game after a few decades of not playing video games, and I haven't tried out Valheim yet.) I've seen that Oregon Trail's graphics has improved, but it's still not the sort of open world, run-around-and-shoot-things-with-arrows I have in mind.  The difference from BotW is (a) no goal other than wandering around North and South America and (b) no teleportation, and generally low-key magic, if any at all. It should fit the situation of what people of the time are likely to have believed. For instance, suppose there is a practice that is believed to cause rain: maybe in the game, it *does* cause rain with a relatively low probability. Keep the players wondering whether it really is effective, and whether they're wasting materials on it—the rational decision anyone would have to make if they really don't know.  The idea of making a BotW-style map the size of North and South America is implausible, but it doesn't need to be filled with human-created puzzles the way BotW is. The map could be generated, using publicly available topographic data as a starting point. The hardest part would be creating appropriate flora and fauna for the different biomes. Or this game could be created and released in stages, expanding the map in response to demand. Or you could ignore this part of the idea and have the end of the game be when the tribe gets clear of the glaciers.  I haven't thought through how there would be a "tribe." Multiple players on a shared server? AI NPCs? The player jumps from controlling one character to another? (As in SimAnt—now I've shown my age.) Not sure. Any ideas?  Finally, there's the issue of doing the history right, and representing the first Americans correctly and honorably. As an Oregon Trail-like game, I'm hoping this idea catches the eye of the first peoples' descendants and historians who are knowledgeable in this area, or at least game developers who would want to collaborate with them.  You may be able to tell that this idea has been brewing for some time. I'm a programmer myself (scientific applications, mostly the LHC) and would be interested in following its development—contributing maybe, or helping to make academic connections—if it gets picked up. But having experience programming makes it all to obvious that I can't do this myself. I'm really impressed at what game developers these days can do!
nrangf, The Next Big Pirate Game, Hear me out. Rust. Mordhau. Sea of Thieves. All mixed into one game.

ITD BE AMAZING
nv8e50, A rpg game idea. Fates choice, Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.  The aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.  Before the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster. The amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages.
nvsftx, Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?, Safety and peace, reader.  This post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.  So I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.  **This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall.   It's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.  ---  **AN ASSASSINATION GAME**  ACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.  But this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.  The flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.  Is an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.  In the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted.   ---  **DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**  In ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.  In ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.  Each city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.  **Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them.   Information gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:  * **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.  * **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.  * **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant.   * **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.  * **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.  All this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.  The Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.  ---  **DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**  In old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins.   *City*  Some of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.  In ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.  These meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.  Targets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.  *Targets*  Other targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the "notoriety system" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.  *Assassins*  You are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.  *How to assassinate?*  Although some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.  The crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.  ---  **SOCIAL STEALTH**  The original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.  Social stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.  ACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.  The policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.  The second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.  Guards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.  The combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you.   To escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.  ACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your "last known position" and "last known trajectory"; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.  *Context Stealth*  The AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not.   But because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)  For example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.  Specific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions.   Furthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.  *The hood*  In AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.  ACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.  If you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.  High level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.  At high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.  *Notoriety*  Notoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.  **PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.  **FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour ("not you again"). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.  **INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.  Notoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.  **JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.  ---  **THE CREED**  *Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.  Hide in plain sight.  Never compromise the brotherhood.*  This is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.  This means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.  There is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.  ---  **PLOT AND SETTING**  Generally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the "threat to be defeated", since it wasn't defeated.  Alternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).  In terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?  Templar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?  It would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.  In terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.  **MODERN DAY STORYLINE**  This is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.  Where does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot?   * It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity.   * Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.  AC's developments here have been:  * Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.  * Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.  I propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.  Firstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.  The apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.  In synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out.   The modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.  The final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.  Additionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine. The bad guy of AC1 has been crushed under the boot of the system you're gonna be taking on.  TL;DR a pointless fantasy. But tell me what you'd like to see.
ntvaon, Anyone Wanna Help Expand Upon My Idea?, So, my idea is about a childlike entity/spirit that goes around collecting souls of the dead that have gotten stuck in between life and death. I was thinking that they would explore a beautiful world, catching spirits in a jar and depositing them in rifts/portals around the map but I’m not sure about a lot of things, like what should it look like?  2D? 3D?  Genre?   Art Style?  Perspective? Top Down, FP, TP, Side Scroller Etc?  Give me your thoughts and if you have any suggestions or wanna expand upon the idea, let me know!  Thanks  Josh
num0sp, 1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game, Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know
nu6lzz, A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants, I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.  Basically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.  Now, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has.   Ants will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.  The world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.  What do you think?
nvbokj, Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp, 
ntogzz, Need Game Ideas, I would like an arcade style game idea. I'm not very creative coming up with this kind of stuff. The target platform is mobile
nveg3r, A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul, (I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)  &amp;#x200B;  Basically -  In this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.  Unfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.  To kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.  &amp;#x200B;  Factions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as   1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.  2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.  &amp;#x200B;  Etc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.  &amp;#x200B;  For upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.  For example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.  If you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.  Upgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc.
ntn76a, A game that players complement in real time,  Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.    The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine    The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.    This "game" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game.
nvc299, Tsunami survive the friends, In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game   Page 2  If you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process  And then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
ntgmz4, Horror idea (kind of like hide and shriek), Game idea  Multiplayer, local or single game (comment what you think)  Horror  ghost or hunter  The ghosts job is to scare the hunters, if the hunter is scared they die. The hunters job is to catch the ghosts, can upgrade weapons with each round, first to 5. if all ghosts are caught the hunters win, if all hunters are killed the ghosts win.   P.S this is my fist game and using core to make my game, can people give game names for ideas
nupwua, My ideas attempt 2, What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players    Page 2  I feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game  Page 3  What happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game    Page 4  Jobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army   Page 5  There will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet  Page 6  Reviving is for teammates and enemies Whoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers  Page 7   Don’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles  Page 8  Guns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding  Page 9 The after life will be a very weird place Every time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server  Someone please make this game Also pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nw1p0j, Survive all family, Has anybody ever ask you if you were on a survival island who would you be with  Now you know  This clash of clans type game  Will be a 3-D game where you were put on an island in the mid evil times  There are a total of five medium size islands around you each of your family members will pick a side The goal is based on teamwork in survival no you do not have to fight your family members unless you want to  Basically there’s wildlife and sharks  The game will actually never end  It’s more like a Minecraft type style game but without the blocks  So your goal inside this game is to survive but you have endless life  Because the grown-up to make the game server well actually be adults  You have to put in an age that decides if your God or not  Now when the children are spawning in  There is a cut scene of a flying golden hair and putting you on the ground  Every time you die this will happen  So it takes place in mid evil times  There are also some natural disasters  Like tsunami‘s earthquakes tornadoes  And rain or thunderstorm  As the days go on your team a family members can build Farm eat or kill  Also the parents can cause natural disasters two but sometimes normally
nvv5zh, My first concept, [deleted]
nuygy5, Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat., 3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard.
nur1zq, Third person tactical shooter, but your squad is made up of unstable psychics, You control your squad a la Mass Effect, and take on missions like in MGS5:Phantom Pain.   Your squad is made up of different types of psychic powers, each with their own special abilities.  Espers can scan the field. Telekinetics can throw stuff. Telepaths can manipulate other soldiers within a specific range.   Your job is to give them orders via psychic messages and to keep them alive. If one dies, it can affect the mental health of your squad mates. And their mental health affects their performance on the field.
ntbj7p, In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder, This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge.   For gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.  For enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction.   Monsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it.   Each Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.  Not sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.  That's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!
nt4ghi, Space-related game?, The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.  (fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)

ny86hc, space mechanic 174 voice controlled atmospheric sifi game, In this game you are a mechanic. On the way to the next job you learn about the functionalities of the ships in the game, the interaction with the ai and the possible game play of your character. Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning. But once you did that it could be an awsome experience and you can also play with friends and make a crew.  Sorry for my bad writting.
ny3fvn, Hello Game Devs, we are hosting our first official game jam! This jam is beginner-friendly and you can team up with members of all skills from our community. It's a great opportunity for those new to game jams and will be a great experience! Let's make some games! :D, [https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam](https://itch.io/jam/stareye-atlas-game-jam)
nxjqbt, A timer in the sky, There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer.   From what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.  Perhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?
nxiogt, Game Ideas, [removed]
numgdo, I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though,    It's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.  There's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.  The actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing.
nxgikz, Want to make an exploring game but have no ideas, The tittle sayd it all. If your idea makes it in thr game, I'll give you credit. Thanks!
o0ltb0, Senso - A war-themed board/card game for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, Hi guys,   I would like to get some feedback on a game I am thinking of developing.   It is a 2-4 player game, set in the pre-historic age. Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it.   Gameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.  There are certain requirements to build units.   1.	Mine – free  2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal  3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal  4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood  5.	Air units – 3x food + metal
nyuckj, Wacky racers battle royale, Base on the hanna barbera cartoon, it's a battle royale kart racing game but you have full customisation of your vehicle, to literally be anything you want, you want a car, a motorcycle, a giant nose that shoots plastic chairs at each nostril, is all up to you.  With the racing itself be like a speed racer meets madmax style death race where you only have 1 life to complete one long singular track
o1f80j, Multiplayer hitman, I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants.  It only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target.  Visuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP. Aesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.    Gameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky. If topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept. End-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received. Game balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it. Thanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it.
o0fxsi, (Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game, Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development.
nvlkg7, Last Effigy, This is a Metroidvania game that is 2d but it be 3d metroidvania like dark souls 1. It mainly build for 2d gameplay.   The player start of as a villager in a planes that lives in a hamlet. The player wake up to abandon hamlet and hears large foots approaching. It a large mix between nature  of Behemoth The resembles a hybrid of animals like the hustle  Elks skull head ,bears chest &amp; arms and buffalo legs.

There's multiple boss battles and small bottles that you would participate in and side quests that you can play but the main boss it's supposed to be a big reveal.
nqx54s, 3 game ideas., **Roguelike. Your body is your own ammo (imagine a guy made of bullets).**  So, whenever you shoot, you lose health points and your body parts fly all over the place. However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.  **Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.**   Flames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.  **Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**  Enemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music. Everything in the game (guns, characters, abilities, items) will be related to 80's disco music and groove.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to hearing your feedback :)
nz7jlh, In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first, Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this.   I had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.  I can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.  So the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters  Or I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.  Which seems like a better option?
o09no1, Question about world building, I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
ny3iiw, Coders/ Devs: Tell us your skills, then we can propose games, I see a lot of posts on here like 'give me a game idea'. Don't get me wrong, that's great and as an 'ideas guy' I really appreciate the chance to pitch a game concept. The problem is we don't know enough about you, you could be using 2d game maker, you could be using unity or unreal engine, or you could specialize in 2d apps, all these things require different types of ideas. So if you'll indulge me and fill out as much of the following as you can, I and others will give you game concepts that are hopefully achievable and suitable for your skills.  Coding Language(s):    Coding experience (beginner/ yrs/ mths):   Tools (eg rpgmaker, unity, swift etc etc):   Game genre(s) you wish to make:   Games you have made or worked on (if applicable):   Your 5 favorite games (or more):   Other relevant material; novels, movies, tv series, art styles etc (eg I want my game to have a Bladerunner influence):   Must haves:   Optional:  Any other comments:

o57r24, Under The Bed(inspired by FNaF 4 from Scott Cawthon), Basically, it starts with a cutscene of something - a stuffy - rolling under your bed. The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters! Every now and then a monster will appear in the closet, which you must use your flashlight to discard. And if you stay looking under the bed for too long, you will be grabbed from behind. There are toys blocking the stuffy, too. Maybe there would be a gamemode where monsters appear on desks and stuff - making the flashlight much more needed.    **(I would prefer if you didn't use this as your own idea)**

o5a1m1, Iam designing a game i call True Iron it follows a Robot that has no name humans have all been made to evacuate on Mars because of Robots that have made Earth theirs your sent out to kill every Human Being but they reprogram you in The End you have only two choices Kill The Robots or Kill The Humans, The Robots themselves havent done anything but The Leaders have These robots are just like Humans its a 2.5d N64 Polygon style No Man's Sky Kind of game but in 2D kind of like Adventure Of Link you can even get new weapons and fuse weapons there are also Metroidvania sections where you wander around Castles and buildings
o5yvp5, Walker vs Infantry Game, Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:  &amp;#x200B;  A Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.  &amp;#x200B;  The rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:  &amp;#x200B;  The player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.  &amp;#x200B;  The player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down.   &amp;#x200B;  Not taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.      The road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.  &amp;#x200B;  Squad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.  &amp;#x200B;  All this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.      Hit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.      The main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance.
o4btug, Idea for a basic Risk-like browser country colonisation game, The idea of the game is simple: defeat your opponents and colonise the world.    The game would be similar to Risk but instead use world province maps, e.g. the ones by MapChart.   Gameplay would start with you selecting a province to start with and involve you earning army units (in either a turn-based fashion or a timer fashion) and expanding your territory into either adjacent provinces or territories on the coast.   It could include levelling up provinces to allow them to earn more tax or make more troops, and of course a system that allows for warfare between players.  Either way, it is meant to be simple and basic, to the point where two players could play on the same device against each other.
o4nu9x, I need ideas for a rpg maker game, Hi guys. I decided to start creating a game with rpg maker. Although I am very excited, i don't have too many ideas, so any help will be appreciated. If your idea appears in the game u will be credited. Thanks.
o821oc, UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead), Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.  PS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said "yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay." I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas
o83x5m, A class-based fighting game based on the "Belief", Essentially, the game is in a 3-d space and has you fight with classes. It mainly uses closer ranged attacks, with the mobility present in the game making ranged classes much, much harder.  Each class is weak, but has a bar called "Belief", similar to a mana or energy bar, which allows you to do actions.  &amp;#x200B;  Things like a Prophet may need teammates nearby and gain Belief by successfully gambling on your miracles.  A Narcissist may need to perform good combos to fuel Belief, as their own belief in themselves is reinforced.  A Champion might want to gain Belief by fighting near multiple players, as others see you as unbeatable.  A Monster gains Belief by not being seen but targeting alone players or using abilities on corpses as fear tactics.  A Liar may start with max belief but using abilities reduces it as your reputation is damaged.  A Hero may start with no belief, but scale upwards by completing "quests" so others hear of their deeds.  A King may have abilities relying on controlling Soldiers to deal damage around him, and gains or loses Belief based on how often enemies kill his Soldiers.

o52pdd, A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras., A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.  My idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in)   The other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something.   I imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.  I feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game.
o4qlkd, An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end., Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs.   Instead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.  You'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers.   Time is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.    So you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides.   And you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains.   The emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier.   You could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story.   Side hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught.   To make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine.   The main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough.   Say you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities.   Or say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.    The best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options.

o39sym, Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe, There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game. For instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)
o454qm, I used GPT3 and GPT2 to make new game ideas based on posts in r/gameideas, Inspired by a previous post on this subreddit, I thought of making a new platform for bot generated game ideas.  The original GPT2 model is trained on 20,000ish posts from the r/gameideas, r/AppIdeas and r/Startup_Ideas subreddits but tends to generate total trash every once in a while.  Thought to augment the system once I got GPT3 for some better but ultimately more bland ideas, but y'all be the judge of that.

nxkexe, Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes), The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional.   &amp;#x200B;  The rules of nature:  &amp;#x200B;  You choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.  &amp;#x200B;  You can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.  &amp;#x200B;  you start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.  You keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.  &amp;#x200B;  If you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power.   &amp;#x200B;  If you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice.   &amp;#x200B;  One of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would.   &amp;#x200B;  Your powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.  Your goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things.   &amp;#x200B;  Thanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???
o9gkrh, In the End, Here is my idea for an RPG. It is about saving the world from man-made disasters and restoring balance.

Any suggestions?

oafzn1, Turok in a Soulsborne format, Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.    It should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.    While Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that "This game but make it soulslike" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay.
o8mvtl, Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse, I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?
o9z3h8, Cat wrestling game?, Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in "combat", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it "Fun Fighting with Furry Friends" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling "matches" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to "bite" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)
o8saev, "Collaborative exploring simulator"?, Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever.   Your goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?  Anyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:  You could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot.
oa3sqf, Business Empire, A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire. You travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself)  Anyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?

o8766q, The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:, I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;  A zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]  An open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.  After creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.  You wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.  You can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.  Set up a camp anywhere, with a "settlement mode" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.  Or.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?  Meet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.  Choose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.  I could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think "my game" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.  I could also go into massive detail about custom settings. "No eating requirements" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.  I'm happy to anwser any questions.  In short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)
o7hx5y, Request for beginner game ideas, I was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a game for a person that's a 1 man team and is still new to programming. I would prefer 3d over 2d but 2d is fine
oak41y, Coordinated Assault FPS, I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost.
o966kx, What would be a good mechanic to add for a 3D FPS game? I mean the mechanics like Hookshot, grappling gun, bullet time etc., 
o4xoay, Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly, Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !     So basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.   Maybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.   For players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.   Then for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.   Also to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.     About the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into "funny" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like "Kick the Buddy" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.   Also the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like "life points" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.  What do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point.
o9n8pk, Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players, **General Principles**  * Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png)) * If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it * Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io  **Expanding on Principles**  * More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard. * Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair. * You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage) * Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.  **Smaller Ideas**  * Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies. * You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.
gzxmm2, A souls-like kart racer, Idk it just sounds like a funny idea. You can develop on it if u want idc.
h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.
hh05i5, LGBTunator - A platformer where you play as a transgender superhero but the catch is the enemies you face are bigots. Each level has multiple zones which leads to a final boss who has kidnapped a member of the LGBT community which you must save. This app would raise awareness to the issues we face., 
hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!
gzwd2c, Mobile game idea, So I have an idea for a mobile game. I don’t know anything about making games but someone who knows DM me
h17ntf, My game idea, So my game idea is about a game that is made Up mini games that you can earn some sort of currency from and you can buy things for the mini games eg: mechs cars tanks and other items a bit like gta adversey game mode but instead it’s a full game can some body make a trailer of this game or a short beta or something I think this would be madd and can u you give me credits if u do
hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.
hir38v, Steampunk fantasy, It's basically steampunk mixed with fantasy in the little bit of wild west
hg8vyg, A game about young man who joins ANTIFA, It’s based on the near future where a young man is initiated into the group and is given tasks to carry out. While doing the tasks he’s given choices as how to carry out the task. As you progress the group tries to get you to do more crazier things. Eventually you get to decide to join them or leave them.   Ps this is just the beginning...
gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.    So far I have the player gets kidnapped and escapes but wants to get revenge. This is a Co-op game 1-4 players.    Also this is planned to have a PC, mobile, and if possible a console release if that helps any.    Also you will get credited for any help you do if your idea goes into the game so if you want to be credited post or DM me how you would with to be credited idc if it’s funny or serious.   Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
guq4bl, Haunted Aim Trainer, It's like Doki Doki Literature Club but with an aim trainer like Kovaak or Aimgod instead of a visual novel.
gwfeys, Short and easy game to make on game maker for a (basically) complete noob?, I know how to code basic things in game maker but never made a real game.
h926mo, Bringing tabletop games to the battle royale genre., Classic RPG Battle Royale is a 5-player fantasy free-for-all bringing traditional tabletop elements to the competitive battle royale genre. Players will create characters and adventure through a randomly generated world, each time creating new characters, quests and diverse biomes making each play though a one of a kind experience. Each will require different tactics leading to a unique narrative as you strive to take out the other players.
h8jsde, A visual novel inspired by Liar Game and Death Note, It could have brain games and puzzles, as well as story impacting decisions. The topic would of course be about some underground/illegal activity, feature investigating people in some way, and piecing clues together smartly from the player's perspective, and the player's decisions would have big consequences, in whichever direction you take the story, and with whomever you associate.
h9c33h, A game with two playthroughs, one with help and one without, This may fall under more of a story idea but basically you know how hand holdy games have NPCs that give you a lot of help? Maybe they'll tell you how to do things or give you items or save you in the story, etc. I think it would be cool to have like a simple hero's journey fighting a timeline breaking villain.   Here's the interesting part though, at the end, the villain warps you back and makes you experience this again except you have to be completely self reliant. Past allies that felt like they genuinely saved you in the first playthrough might either not be there or even might be turned against you.   For example, there's the classic cliche of being near death and having some hermit save and heal you (kinda like Made in the Abyss.) In playthrough 1 you might go through an area that takes end game skills to survive but you die and it triggers the hermit storyline. In playthrough 2 you might be expected to survive that area and know that no help is coming. This could even lead to a ton of new areas metroidvania style.   Overall I just think it'd be cool if you had two playthroughs: one where you feel like you got boosted by a genuinely good team so your character acts like a naive nobel Knight and another where you have to be extremely self reliant and you come back as a scarred badass with much darker methods.   I know there's not much game stuff in there but I encourage discussion and fleshing this out. I don't seriously care if it's turned into a game or not but I'm curious what form it might take.
h9bdt1, Star Wars open world game, Open world game   Customize your lightsabers, blasters, (vehicles maybe?) etc  Choose fighting styles for different weapons  Get in a starship and fly to different planets, or get in a speeder and explore the planet you're on  Take over territory  Build or recruit your own army/militia, and find a way to supply them with weapons, training, and vehicles  Larger territory = you have more space to get more troops  Hunt alien creatures and get trophies from your prized kill to put in your starship or base   Online mode    Fight with other players and take over the galaxy, or make peace and bring down other players evil empires  Maybe reset your land every time you log in to an online session?

h0b4xd, TV station manager (similar to airport ceo), Just a random idea I had. Have like a TV station / production company manager, with similar style to prison architect and airport ceo (like sign contracts with shows and hire workers)
h0jgd6, BR "Circles/storms" could be better..., I may do something like this already, but you are all free to make a better version haha.  The idea is that a player is in an area, a building or outside, and instead of a storm closing in like in battle royale games, various rooms close or parts of the map get contaminated.  The player could be fighting enemies and they have to keep in mind that the room they are in could shut down at any moment (with warning of course).  The goal could be to survive long or to make it to the final room.
gyibm0, Collectible Battle Dice!, Hi everyone,  I'm thinking of creating a sort of RPG "battle dice" game, where players defeat monsters and other players in Dice combat. Essentially, battle would involve players choosing their dice to roll (maybe 5-10 at a time) each of which has different attributes (e.g. Basic Fire Die, rolls for 1-6 Fire damage). After a few rounds of combat, defeated enemies would drop loot such as rare die, or gold which can be used to buy more dice.   There will be an inventory system, where players can view and manage the dice they own, sort of like Pokemon. A "leveling up" system could also work, where each type of die has experience which can level up its base roll values.   Anyway, I'm posting this here because I'm not sure if this sounds like a fun idea or not. Any sort of feedback is welcome and appreciated! :)
gz90o6, F-Zero except faster, I'm talking 'light years' faster. Planet to planet race courses. Imagine a game that utilized the lightspeed mechanic like Elite Dangerous does, with pvp events mid-race. Perhaps players could activate stargates after a good dogfighting when they reach a certain point. Or landing straight into a space terminal course that you have to then reach the finish line to blow up before traveling to the next courses? (Anyone still on it will lose the match). I kinda miss F-Zero and I look to it and anime like Redline as a point of reference.  With more games that use procedurally generated environments, I can definitely see this being a possibility now.
gw6efm, Need a story idea for a short RPG game that I can finish!, Hello! My name's Val and I've been having a lot of trouble coming up with ideas for a short project I could make with RPG Maker. Before I say what I can do and what I'm looking for, I wanted to say that I need a simple idea because I never managed to finish a game before. I have this problem with giving up on ideas right after I start them, but thanks to one of my dearest friends I've realized how serious of a problem it is, and how easy it is to fix.   So, I decided to make a simple project that I will be able to finish before the quarantine is over!   I also wanted to point out my strengths and my weaknesses when it comes to game design:  * I'm very experienced in RPG Maker, I've used it since when I was very young. So I can say for certain that I'm a veteran when it comes to events and plugins and all the good stuff. (When you give up on 50+ projects, you have to learn SOMETHING) * I'm an artist. I've also been drawing since when I was younger and consider myself pretty good at it. I have no problem making my own assets for a game! * I'm not a good programmer. Right now, I'm taking some online classes with a very good teacher from my country but I'm still a beginner, so I can't make my own plugins and such. (I'm Brazillian btw) * As said before, I tend to give up easily, It's my greatest weakness when it comes to game design and other things in general, and I wanted to try and at least finish a project, even if it's not that great.  Okay, so with that out of the way, I ask that if anyone is willing to give me a game idea that can fit or be adapted for RPG Maker: Please make sure it's an RPG and that the idea can give me room to expand my abilities and not give up as easily!   I offer my thanks and credit for anyone who decides to offer me an idea! (I'm sorry I can't offer much more)
h82ujx, CSGO And Dishonored Mash-Up, This idea just came to me, what would happen if there was a game like CSGO but you had superpowers similar to that of Dishonored. I’m not talking about VALORANT, I mean like Dishonored stuff like Emily’s Far reach ability or something like that. Maybe another ability where you could throw your smoke grenade and instead of it Instantly puffing up with smoke you could throw it and shoot it with your gun for more precise detonations or a Sniper That has the ability to global scope, meaning instead of you scoping into one area using the awp you can actually move the awp to another area while your character is still in another area and shoot an enemy from across the map.   I don’t know just thought this would be cool to see happen. Thoughts 🤷‍♀️
gu641v, Team fortress-like shooter., We all know the tf2 devs are kind of silent right now, we need something similar, we need something that can enterntain but get developer support too, and we need something that dosent have a "Kill everyone close to you" button. A class based first person shooter with 6 (Kind of) original characters, organized on a "Class triangle" that categorizes them as more of a offensive, defensive or supportive character, classes can also be inbetween theese categories (Half offensive-half defensive, Half defensive-half support and half support-half offense) Lt. Lemoustch - The soldier (French, married his Fmas) is a purely offensive. Mudamir - The maniac (Arabian, pyromaniac and explosive expert) is a genralist character. Il grande - The boss (Italian ex mafia boss) is a purely defensive/tanky character. Sharpie - The sharpshooter (Kind Canadian sniper) is a long range finisher. Lifesaver - The field medic (British, hates his team) is a generalist who can act as a support. Golden - The scout (American, got drafted) is a "Flanker" character. Open to more ideas.
hbm7yp, Single screen isometric RPG, Hi, I've noticed that I often get tired in games because of huge amount of info, locations, characters, items etc. So I think about minimalistic RPG world where whole game takes place on one screen, for example a kingdom in a right top corner, goblin's tribe in another corner and some random (or even procedural generated) items in other places but on one screen so the player sees whole simulated RPG world at once . Maybe it will be a hard gamedesign challenge to try make this world interesting but I think there are many options because of main idea - you actually see any events all the time, what do you think about it?
hb8msj, Requesting ideas for a game about painting (video of current progress included), My sister likes to draw so I thought I'll make a painting game for her birthday, it'll be a free little game on the web. Here is what I have so far [https://youtu.be/zDgezW1ReS0](https://youtu.be/zDgezW1ReS0).   The initial idea was to have the top right corner display a famous painting e.g. Mona Lisa, and you have 60seconds to paint it out, but this idea feels a little dry tbh, and I'm wondering if you have a more interesting direction for me to take this further.  Much appreciated!
hddi9s, Marvel Ant-Man Game, So I imagine this being similar to the Playstation Spider-man game. Maybe even being another PS exclusive. So you would play as Ant-Man in San Francisco (The setting of the MCU movies) and where as Spider-man had the ability to move around by web swinging. Ant Man would be able to shrink down at will. Allowing you to go into sewer drains under the city. Slide down gutter pipes and ,of course, ride a flying ant to get around quickly.  On top of this there would also be a skill point system allowing you to upgrade your abilities and control different types of ants or being able to control larger amounts of ants. Ants would be used in a variety of ways depending on which type but their main use would be to distract unaware criminals or coating the criminals so that they would be temporarily disarmed. But ants arent the only thinv you could upgrade, being able to quickly dodge bullets by shrinking down and jumping off of them allowing you to follow up by attacking the criminal. Or even being able to shrink/grow certain objects like cars, soda cans or even your own ants. Missions would consist of doing several activities that would require you to be able to shrink down in size. Such as being able to disarm a bomb from the inside or having to gather intel on a suspect by hiding in a part of their clothing and being carried around with them. You would also of course have to face off against several villains such as Yellowjacket, Ghost, Crossfire and Taskmaster just to name a few. So whilst Ant-Man isnt as popular as Spider-Man he would definatley create an amazing action game with some unique mechanics! Also be sure to comment any feedback or any ideas you have for this.
hd6ezx, Stealth management sim, I had this idea about a stealth management simulation where you get hired by clients to protect their facilities from intruders and you have to manage your employees in order to achieve this task. Think Metal Gear Solid 1, only you control the guards/commander.  \- You get a certain budged based on your contract and facility  \- You hire a set of employees with different stats  \- You have a running day time circle with 3 different shifts (morning shift, evening shift, night shift)  \- You assign employees to particular shifts for a week and then go into more micromanaging their behaviours  \- You assign patrol points for your employee  \- You order security gears to be delivered to your facility so you can install them  \- You decide if your employee should stay on overtime or go home after a shift ends, but overtime decreases their stats  \- Every Monday there is a new set of applicants with different stats that you can choose to hire permanently  \- Every x in-game hours there is an intruder spawned in at a random location who is trying to sneak a layer deeper into your facility. Each layer could be a room or an area.  \- Once an intruder reaches the core/whatever it is you protect, the game is over.  \- In each deeper layer it takes the intruder longer to reach his subgoal  \- An intruder can be spotted by line of sight, motion sensors, security cameras etc.  \- If you spot an intruder you can command employees to fight that intruder or protect certain exits  \- You can also decide to shut down certain rooms/areas to narrow the area where the intruder currently exists and flush him/her out.
hdmxvn, A Turn-Based, First Person Shooter, **Idea:**  A turn-based FPS game. You play a match in a very small map/arena. There is your team, and the enemy's team.  It's your turn. You have 4 seconds to think, and 6 seconds to respond. You can either move, or shoot.  * To move, you press WASD, and you can only move. * To shoot, you either just shoot with LMB, or aim with RMB.  Each player takes its turn. The more you damage an enemy, the more "credits" you get.  With those credits, at the start of each round (when the turn cycle is repeated), you can buy grenades, shields, drones, etc., which you can use in your turns.  **P.S.**: I am a game developer, but I don't have the time to make this game myself. So I thought I'd post it here, as this is something I would really want to play!  Although if anyone wants to collab, let me know. I have some experience in Unity.
hdzo5e, Requesting a action packed 2D offline game, Want to make a game with some explosions and action, but not many creativity. I'm not exactly asking for fully fleshed out games; I would greatly appreciate just mechanics to have my gears start spinning. I'm leaning towards side scrolling but top down is fine.  Now, I could go out of my comfort zone and make something outside of these specs such as a online multiplayer or 3D game, but I'm not too confident in my skills for that...
he5tyr, A Pokémon idea, So this is simply a cool vision I’ve had, also I’m new here so I put it as dream.  Anyway my dream is that the “evil guy” is a ditto who has transformed into a Zourak which is a Pokémon that can make itself look like humans exactly, this will be the case if the whole ditto keeps its beady eyes when it transforms, or they could wear glasses. Anyway this ditto is upset of trainers who run through tall grass and hurt the innocent Pokémon that you run into. So his idea is to make a mirror dimension that is the exact same as the one the Pokémon come from but humans aren’t allowed in. Near the end the guy will activate a portal where all Wild Pokémon are drawn to. It’s sorta like mind control but they go through the portal and wake back up in the same spot they just were when the thing activates. The idea behind this is that Pokémon won’t want to leave there homes so the guy(naming him DG to make things easier) made their homes exactly the same and so humans won’t hurt them ever again. It’s sorta like mystery dungeon where no humans are ever seen but Pokémon know about them.                  Unfortunately the Pokémon never come back because to them this place doesn’t look any different from the real world and DG’s intentions are good. The only way to get Pokémon is to pay DG or his henchmen to go in, and this place functions as one of those parks where you bring no Pokémon but have balls to toss and hope to get one. There is no more grinding on innocent Pokémon in the wild and Pokémon fights are only with Pokémon partners that were caught. This is basically Pokémon becoming intelligent enough to want rights.                                         Anyway this is my small dream/vision that will never happen and I hope you enjoyed.              TL;DR: Pokémon want rights

hdtfue, [mechanic] An alternative to stat inflation in RPGs: increasingly-smart mob AI plus randomized-per-character combat movement, One of my bugbears in RPGs is stat inflation.   Take your average diabolike and hide the damage text everywhere - the difficulty cycles from 3 hits to kill a mob, down to 2 and eventually 1 as you gain levels/gear, then back up to 3 as you move to a new area (rendering all your gains worthless), rinse and repeat.   And the same principles apply to open-world RPGs like Skyrim or The Witcher. As you gain in power, enemies become increasingly bullet-spongy and damage-dealy... and it's just boring.  Even if you turn off level-scaling, tough mobs are just a matter of chipping flecks off a massive health pool, while avoiding getting stomped - just a slog, really.   I was thinking back to the combat in Witcher 1 the other day, and how it was strongly timing-based; button-mashing would get you killed every time, whereas getting into the rhythm, judging distance and anticipating attacks would win you the fight.  So what we picked up that concept and ran with it?   Replace increasing mob power (eg health pool and damage output) with increasing mob *skill*, give higher-level critters a bigger repertoire of combat behaviours and tighter timing, make them less susceptible to button-mashing, and less button-mashy themselves, requiring more skill to defeat instead of bigger numbers. Make it take the same number of solid hits to kill them - but make it harder to achieve that.   Now, I hear you asking how you make this feel like the *character* progressing rather than the player, and I've got you covered.   Make the default AI weightings and timings and speeds for each mob type different for each character you generate. Mess with the PC's attack ranges, parry speed, inertia and momentum a little, so that starting a new character throws your muscle memory way off. Make them just plain better at some things and worse at others than previous characters, so you stumble around like a newbie again and are terrible at the game until you get the heft of them. And if you have to make the character themselves progress, give them ways to make their character more responsive and their moves more tunable.   From there you can even take all the numbers off gear, and just let it handle differently - with no objectively-better gear, just stuff that's a better or worse fit for your character and playstyle, and you discover that by *trying* it.   Now you've got skill-based combat that still feels like your character is getting better at the world, with no walking-demigod problem creeping up on you.
hbtg5q, A single player zombie survival but it’s unique, So I’ve got a game idea that I’ve had for a while.   It’s a single-player 1st/3rd person survival game. It’s set in some city/region. It’s a zombie apocalypse (walking-dead style zombies).  This idea is obviously not new, but there’s 2 features that I haven’t seen implemented *together*. The first is building a large base (thinking similar to The Forest or Rust) and having to build things like farms, walls, guard posts etc. The second is NPC companions that interact with you in 3 different ways.   1. Friendly/join you   2. Hostile/fight you  3. Non-hostile/trade with you   Both hostile and non-hostile NPCs I want to build their own bases over the course of the game, and I want non-hostile groups to gain contact with the player and trade with/ally with the player.   I feel like State of Decay was clunky and not done super well. I’d prefer an inventory system similar to ones like: No Mans Sky, The Outer Worlds, Borderlands etc. I also feel like having NPCs act independently of the player is something I really want though I understand the limitations of that.
gw067u, Handshaking Simulator - a tongue in cheek game with high-stakes hands greetings, a punishing score system and cringe-inducing awkwardness when you fail., More than anything, this game is about giving players that uncomfortable feeling when they miss a high-five or grab a fist bump. The music is cheerful and upbeat... **until you fail,** at which point the music stops and all the player is left with is silence, a dead stare by the NPC and a draining score slowly dropping into the negatives.  But with the bad also comes the good: You can get really good at special best friend handshakes, like an intricate dance, and all the NPCs around you cheer and record on their phones. If you nail it perfectly, someone pulls you aside: the President is calling you to personally congratulate you on the flawless handshake.

hacuap, Turned based horror with ps2 (possibly ps1) graphics + recruiting help !, Hi! My name is Zee, and I'm currently working on a turned based horror game that's influenced by Japanese Horror, Psychological Horror, Shin Megami Tensei 3, &amp; Persona 3, Madoka Magica, &amp; Parasite Eve.  Marked: Imaginary Days (working title)  The game follows a girl named Nia and her friends a photographer named Nyles &amp; a guitarist and singer named Chelsea (aka Checkers), Nia is a college student studying to become a journalist and the biggest mystery at the college is simply why do so many seniors disappear after the big senior party? After almost 50 years of not having a giant party, they finally decided to have one again at the signature Ζ Ψ Κ (Zeta Psi Kappa) mansion, and after mingling around the party and stopping one of Chelsea's exes from trying to start a big fight, the trio make their way downstairs and see an odd symbol on the floor, Nyles becomes incredibly cold, Chelsea begins to see a doll, and Nia hears an old woman whispering to her.  and after touching it that's when everything goes to shit.   If you're interested in this small premise/intro I would appreciate any help I can get, I'm not very experienced in anything but writing and graphic design as well as some directing and I would love to work with a group of people on this  I am more than willing to pay for any help so please if you're interested message me ♥️
hdi97m, a dating sim and there is exactly one character for every popular "dere" trope. tsundere yandere kuudere etc., I'd play it lol
hbb6am, A "build your own troops" kind of strategy game, First of all this is a huge project, but I have to clear my mind a bit so I'm writing it down.   So I don't know if any of you have played a flash game called battlecry.  I played it a lot when I was around 15 years old.  Well in short it just evolves around the idea that you have a certain amount of points per level.  The points are used to create soldiers by giving them equipment or traits from 5 categories, Race, Armor, Weapon, Offhand (shields and dagger ect.) and Special (which was like mounts and magic stuff).  Every item had a different cost of points, and the soldiers cost was just all those points added together.  For example you made, let's say, an Orcish bowman with plate armor. And named the soldier type "the gren guard" or something epic like that.  So Orc 5p +Shortbow 4p +Armor 7p =16p 1 green guard cost 16p and 10 green guards 160p  I'm thinking of implementing the same kind of "Build your own army" -mechanic with the kind of 3D battles known from something like the total war -series.    Custom battles would be set up by deciding the amount of points for each army. Then having 10's or 100's of custom made soldiers battling against each other.  It could even have some kind of a campaign or anything.
hdmqvl, A game where you build city on island, I was thinking of a game where you can build a city on an island with no limit on solders and buildings. You can use this island to attack other peoples islands but it is not like the mobile games. More like a game like planetary annihilation.
h9qr4b, protesters vs cops (like plants vs zombies), with the current peaceful protests marred by shocking and unjustifiable police brutality, some protesters have found creative ways to protect themselves. i imagine a mobile game similar to plants vs zombies where the protesters are like the defending plants and the cops are the attacking zombies.   cop attack tactics: - night sticks - riot gear - helicopters - flash bangs - pepper spray (spray can or hose) - tear gas (gas machine or projectile canisters) - rubber bullets - tasers - police cars ramming crowds - shoving protesters, holding to ground  protester defense tactics: - masks and goggles to protect from tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, coronavirus, etc - hats, sunglasses, discreet clothing to prevent identification  - get well dressed white people to act as a barrier against cops - umbrellas to protect against pepper spray - traffic cones, leaf blowers to reduce tear gas exposure - tennis rackets to swat back tear gas canisters - water jugs to put out tear gas canisters - squirt bottles to rinse eyes - smartphone to take videos - ear plugs to protect against flash bangs  i got a ton of ideas from [this fordham observer article ](https://fordhamobserver.com/46960/featured-stories/protest-guide-dress-for-success-and-survival/)

hclqzy, INTERESTING GAME TITLE, Hi everyone! I’m thinking of interesting title for my game project. The game is about a IT professional/Computer genius who invented a path inside the computer to fight for viruses. My old title is “Eliminate That Virus!” but ofcourse the title needs revision. I’m thinking of a good quality and catchy topic. Anyone here has an idea?? Thank you so much for the answer.
hfide6, 4 player free for all, Top down "shooter" with up to 4 players in an arena. You fight waves of enemies with 4 possible player classes like ranged, melee, support or healer, but you're under no obligation to work with each other. At the end of each round scores are added up, you get points for kills, bonuses for teamwork and deductions for deaths, kill bonuses included killing other players. Basically you're both rewarded for helping and hindering each other to add to competitiveness. Every now and then a boss round will pop up with a harder boss enemy and harder waves of normal enemies, teamwork on these rounds pay out higher. Just a fun little arcade style game.

hfyprb, Solar Sands- A game where you pilot a solar surfer, harnessing the power of the sun to explore a sprawling desert wasteland., The main mechanic revolves around utilising and managing solar energy from the sun to power the player's vehicle - a solar surfer. This is a snowboard esque design, with a large spread mast that powers it across the desert dunes.  The setting is a sunken desert wasteland, the remains of fallen cities and buildings drowned in the sands. The player is free to explore these ruins to find upgrades for themselves and their vehicle.  Environmental dangers are a main mechanical threat for the player -  The player must manage their power reserves for the night, in which they are unable to draw power from the sun and must rely on their reserves to keep them alive. The night exposes the player to harsh temperatures. Without power, the players life support system will begin to fail and their vehicle will become inoperable.  Periodic desert sandstorms are also a threat to the player, as they can damage your vehicle (e.g tearing the sails). You can hide from these in interiorss such as sand caverns.  Players can upgrade their solar surfer to increase resiliance against nature, as well as increases to maximum power reserves.  Story wise, the player should passively uncover the lore of the world and what happened to it through story bites that the player must freely find throughout the world. (Similar to dark souls, but a bit more upfront)  Im completely new to this, but i would love to just get something created with this idea of mine if anyone else shares the same passion with it as i do.  Let me know :)
hewne3, Conker' Bad Fur Day Sequel, So, the game blatantly ripped off movies in the first one (Saving Private Ryan, The Matrix etc.). This one is a rip-off of Assassin's Creed. Conker gets swept up in a plot where he needs to go into an Animus- type machine that has him assume the life of an ordinary red squirrel. I'm thinking an Over the Hedge style world where you parkour through a suburban landscape, taking part in a medieval war between red squirrels and grey squirrels. I'm thinking of a free run mechanic that has you flying through the trees as fast and fluid as PS4 Spider Man. All the while, strange human stories populate the world below you and creates hilarious social commentary. I've been thinking about this a lot and I would love to see this be a reality.
hg1kbf, Angels: Die over and over to achieve the final ending, A game that might tire you out the first 5+ rounds of playing, but each loop is crucial to achieve the final ending.  You play as a young angel who has 100% health and wings filled with layers of feathers that allow you to fly to more places.  The story: The Spire, a giant Star, has shattered, scattering the Star Fragments all over the kingdom (unnamed kingdom for now). Your task is to gather the fragments and then reform The Spire, but there's a twist; for every fragment you collect, you give up a layer of feathers and a piece of your health.  The ending: Once you have gotten all fragments, you are free to enter the final area of the game. With only a small layer of feathers and 1% of your health, you give up your life to form The Spire once again.  The twist: You are rebirthed, just as how The Spire shatters again. However, the more friends you made, the less health and feathers you spend. However (again), for each layer of feathers lost, you can either sell or craft something from the molten feathers. A good bonus is that any and all things crafted and money made will transfer over into your next life.  The final and ultimate ending allows you to form The Spire with all feather layers and 100% health.  After that, you can either reset the game entirely and start anew, or explore the kingdom to your heart's content.   What do you think?
hepmh2, Completely physics based crafting/building., I've had this idea for quite some time and has only seen one other person post something similar ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3fvlha/survival_game_with_physics_based_crafting_a_few/)), but it's a physics based building and crafting system where all interactions and crafting are not based on grids (like minecraft) or squashing two objects together.  Basically, lets say you have a stick and a rock, you can "glue" the stick and the rock together however you want and use it however you want. Maybe you use it as a hammer to hammer in nails or pegs into something to secure it in place.   Now take an axe (maybe made from rocks you smashed together to create shards?) and a log, you start chopping the wood into a plank. This plank can then be used like the other stuff, however you want. Perhaps you use it to build the door for a house, or maybe a bridge to cross some water.  Or you take the plank and cut a hole in the middle of it, now you can insert another stick into the plank, making a joint. This can possibly be used to create a windmill, that is connected to a large milling stone that grinds the wheat you harvested with that sharpened bone you made. Or perhaps use it for a lever (crane type) to lift a heavy rock somewhere.  The mechanic/game would most likely be VR since it's hard to control with precision how parts move and interact with mouse and keyboard.  &amp;#x200B;  Love to see more ideas and critique about this, and maybe someday my dream of building stuff from scratch will be fullfilled.
hfsvwq, I want some Fe₃Cr₂CoO₄ ideas, I want to make a game so i am asking for ideas based in using ferro-magnetic tape Class FeO₂, CrO₂, (the forgotten) FeCr and FeCo (commonly known as cassette), for example giving you a diferent weapon depening on the tape or a diferent ability, and also having to rewind the tape to recharge the ability (for giving it a reason why it needs to recharge that).
hfxtpu, A Business Simulator where you run a Toy Company,  I have this idea to make a tycoon game where you start a toy company around the mid 1970s and create a bunch of different toys like action figures, dolls, and other stuff while researching new themes and gimmicks. You'd also be able to commission multimedia projects like cartoons, comics, and other things to spread the name of your brand. Is there already a game like or similar to that? If not, do you have any recommendations on how I (an amateur) can make a game like that?
hdjsq6, I've got a game idea where basically that the entire point of the game is that if it is a game maybe that the game can work for any new game and if it works for you maybe the game can have a unique feature for having a game on the new console so that the game would play like a better game?,

hhrxsj, Liquid Love - requesting critique and suggestions, STAGE 1  I am a nameless artist.  I have a ghost girlfriend. Every night I would paint a portrait of her cute face. (I love you baby ; 3)  During the day I work as a dishwasher.  STAGE 2  When we go on dates and I'm short on cash, I would use my painting skill to forge paper money, so we can go see a movie.  When she's dirty, we'd go to the beach and I'll wash her off.  When she's hungry, I'd draw cakes for her to eat. (I'll make you fat and fluffy baby &gt;\_&lt;)  STAGE 3  One day, we walked past a monk by the side of the road. I told the monk that I'm in love with a ghost.  The monk says, paint me a temple and I'll make your wish come true.  So I did, and my girlfriend came to life.  STAGE 4  Unfortunately, the monk was an evil monk. He used the temple to open a portal for demons to come through. I must fight them off using my painting skills!  STAGE 5  My gf confessed to me that she's actually the monk's spy sent to manipulate me. If I close the portal, she would disappear also. I said, in that case, I'll come with you! I poured paint on myself and turned myself into a ghost.  \---  Comment: I thought the artist could work as a dishwasher and go to the beach because there seems to be some interesting connection between putting paint on and washing dirt off.   Any critique of the mechanics, narrative, theme is welcomed!  Demo of the painting mechanic [https://hiryujupiter.itch.io/ghostpainter](https://hiryujupiter.itch.io/ghostpainter)

h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?

gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.

hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!

hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.

gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example.

If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.

gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.

Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.

h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.

hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!
gzwd2c, Mobile game idea, So I have an idea for a mobile game. I don’t know anything about making games but someone who knows DM me
h17ntf, My game idea, So my game idea is about a game that is made Up mini games that you can earn some sort of currency from and you can buy things for the mini games eg: mechs cars tanks and other items a bit like gta adversey game mode but instead it’s a full game can some body make a trailer of this game or a short beta or something I think this would be madd and can u you give me credits if u do
hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.

gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.    So far I have the player gets kidnapped and escapes but wants to get revenge. This is a Co-op game 1-4 players.    Also this is planned to have a PC, mobile, and if possible a console release if that helps any.    Also you will get credited for any help you do if your idea goes into the game so if you want to be credited post or DM me how you would with to be credited idc if it’s funny or serious.   Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.
gzxmm2, A souls-like kart racer, Idk it just sounds like a funny idea. You can develop on it if u want idc.
h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.
hh05i5, LGBTunator - A platformer where you play as a transgender superhero but the catch is the enemies you face are bigots. Each level has multiple zones which leads to a final boss who has kidnapped a member of the LGBT community which you must save. This app would raise awareness to the issues we face., 
hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!
gzwd2c, Mobile game idea, So I have an idea for a mobile game. I don’t know anything about making games but someone who knows DM me
h17ntf, My game idea, So my game idea is about a game that is made Up mini games that you can earn some sort of currency from and you can buy things for the mini games eg: mechs cars tanks and other items a bit like gta adversey game mode but instead it’s a full game can some body make a trailer of this game or a short beta or something I think this would be madd and can u you give me credits if u do
hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.

hg8vyg, A game about young man who joins ANTIFA, It’s based on the near future where a young man is initiated into the group and is given tasks to carry out.

gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.    So far I have the player gets kidnapped and escapes but wants to get revenge. This is a Co-op game 1-4 players.    Also this is planned to have a PC, mobile, and if possible a console release if that helps any.    Also you will get credited for any help you do if your idea goes into the game so if you want to be credited post or DM me how you would with to be credited idc if it’s funny or serious.   Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.
gzxmm2, A souls-like kart racer, Idk it just sounds like a funny idea. You can develop on it if u want idc.
h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.
hh05i5, LGBTunator - A platformer where you play as a transgender superhero but the catch is the enemies you face are bigots. Each level has multiple zones which leads to a final boss who has kidnapped a member of the LGBT community which you must save. This app would raise awareness to the issues we face., 
hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.

gzwd2c, Mobile game idea, So I have an idea for a mobile game. I don’t know anything about making games but someone who knows DM me

hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.
hir38v, Steampunk fantasy, It's basically steampunk mixed with fantasy in the little bit of wild west
hg8vyg, A game about young man who joins ANTIFA, It’s based on the near future where a young man is initiated into the group and is given tasks to carry out. While doing the tasks he’s given choices as how to carry out the task. As you progress the group tries to get you to do more crazier things. Eventually you get to decide to join them or leave them.   Ps this is just the beginning...
gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.

Also this is planned to have a PC, mobile, and if possible a console release if that helps any.    Also you will get credited for any help you do if your idea goes into the game so if you want to be credited post or DM me how you would with to be credited idc if it’s funny or serious.   Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.
gzxmm2, A souls-like kart racer, Idk it just sounds like a funny idea. You can develop on it if u want idc.
h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.
hh05i5, LGBTunator - A platformer where you play as a transgender superhero but the catch is the enemies you face are bigots. Each level has multiple zones which leads to a final boss who has kidnapped a member of the LGBT community which you must save. This app would raise awareness to the issues we face., 
hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!

hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.

gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.  Gameplay videos:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGgl\_d9vQGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGgl_d9vQGc)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juXC8F3UxV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juXC8F3UxV4)  &amp;#x200B;  Other informative links:  [https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/lion-pride](https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/lion-pride)  [https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/015447/lion-pride/](https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/015447/lion-pride/)
gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.

gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
h04sab, Vietnam war idea, I know this seems like a giant project but it seemed fun to share my idea Even if no one makes it and in the rare event you make it please contact me in the comments.I Thought of a game that evolves as you play and how you make decisions. The Game Centers around a squadron of four navy seals in Vietnam that find KGB intel of a secret importation of a nuke being transported piece by piece. The team has to find intel to where it is being assembled By raiding bases and a few intense interrogations. The game is a semi realistic third person shooter like ghost Recon advanced warfighter one and two as basic mechanics go. the Main mechanic that makes it different than other games is the fact That all actions have consequences good or bad and it is almost impossible to not have at least two squad deaths. it has no dialogue options the only way the game is affected is by the tactics you choose and what decisions you make during the levels. as far as characters go the Main character is named Clint and is the archetypal buff badass But is Very nice and lighthearted but reveals a version of himself that is affected by ptsd which is a theme of the game. I imagine he looks a little like Vito Scaletta from mafia  2. that’s all I’ve come up with for characters so far. a large section of the game is spent when the squad gets stranded in a helicopter crash and has to scrounge for med supplies and ammo. You have to prioritize medical supplies for the squad. You have to decide who to give med supplies and prioritize different members of the squad. The final level you have to dive  up a river  and run to the facility where the nuke is being built That happens to be on a cliff side. The squad finds the main villain who is very briefly mentioned in the beginning and is a Russian commander who is viewing the nuke being built that day. eventually you tap into a Vietnamese radio transmission during a huge fight that says they are sending a secondary nuke that was built offsite and reinforcements. the fight dies Down enough that an evac helicopter for the squad. Clint ends up not taking the evac helicopter and staying their to disarm the nuke that’s being built. this section is a stealth section that ends with him dropping on to a conveyor belt that has pipes on the edge that swing over a cliff ledge about 10 feet down that houses the nuke secretly inside of it. He is soon followed by the main villain holding a gun to his head. The main villain shoots him in the leg dropping Clint  onto his knees infront of him. the good ending which depends on your decisions clint throws a stick into the barrel of the main villains gun jamming his gun giving him enough time to jump off the side of the cliff face and avoid the nuke blast. the final scene sees clint’s silhouette on the edge of an aircraft carrier during sunrise with a cast on his arm. The bad ending is The same thing in the cliff except instead of throwing a stick into the main villains barrel he says “go to hell” and injects himself with cyanide in his neck and falls off the cliff And that’s when the ending commences. Side notes(probably should of mentioned this as I was explaining the game but this works too): the game is called Sunrise, The ending takes place during a thunderstorm and ends at sunrise with The rain cleared At both endings, and unlockable outfits are a thing and the final level gives you an outfit that is just Clint wearing UDT shorts and an ALICE rig.
hdxv5z, A Random Collection Game, A game that takes advantage of the steam inventory system for easy trading, where you open packs for in-game currency that drop random crafting items which can be used to make random weapons, armor and housing items.  The only area you walk around is a huge flat space that you can use to summon enemies and test out your completley random weapons and stuff. Every week you can defeat so many enemies for the in game currency, which will be used to buy the packs.  Items can be pulled from r/itemshop, but the range of items should be infinite.  No in app purchases, as they'd take away from the game.  Items can be used to learn useless skills, which will make the arena-esqe fighting much more fun.  I've imagined a game like this for years, but in my boredom today I just thought to write down a proof of concept.
hd8sjy, Foreign Language Game Ideas, I am looking to create a foreign language learning game, but I am lacking any creative drive. Feel free to leave any ideas below, it can be any genre really. I plan on adding multiple target languages for the user as well, rather than a single language game. Any help is appreciated, been wanting to do this idea for a while now but haven't really made anything both entertaining and educational. My audience reach is essentially anyone, even non-language learners who just want to pick up the game and accidentally start learning a language haha. Thanks!
hhg1go, Anyone got a mobile game idea?, Something small, simple.  Like Pong, but not as boring.
he6isc, Pokémon MMORPG, Ok hear me out here : a Pokémon MMORPG  Basically at the beginning every one starts as a trainer and eventually you get the choice to be a gym leader or continue as a trainer. There could be a single player mode like a normal game and after you beat it you unlock the choice (or some other version of an entree level so you don’t just have a starter going in). Anyways, onto the multiplayer, I’m imaging a trophy system. The game matches you with similar/slightly harder gym leaders (real people) that you have to beat to get trophies. You can like compare trophies with your friends. Also I think it should be every 1000 trophies you get the trainer/gym leader choice again. The gym leaders could choose when to have their gyms open/closed. So they can go and train with their friends or by themselves with out having to switch to the trainer role. I’m not sure how gym leaders would work to switch. There could be a card for your player that says “Trainer Trophies : _____ Gym Leader Trophies : ________” that also adds incentive to switch roles. And the trainer/leader match ups would be by level/win-loss rate. Also they might need to change the level system because them everyone would just have level 100 Pokémon and high level you don’t have to grind out perfect ivs. So petty much a battle revamp as well because did you look at competitive Pokémon it’s WAY too grindy. Just grinding for the perfect Pokémon then level sharing until they can level on their own up to 100.   I know it’s a little far fetched (lol Pokémon) but I think it could work.  TLDR: Pokemon game where you can choose gym leader or trainer + new leveling system  Edit: You can switch roles whenever, you just have to go to a building or something
hdhcr9, i might seem like a seven year old, you know how to train your dragons? well take the content from all the movies, the tv show and stuff and make an mmorpg out of it. it would be sick as hell. Im watching the series with my younger sister and while shes enjoying the action im thinking of what a cool game this would be. EA you up for this?
hi0ump, An action adventure management game where you fight/tame/ride mythological monsters from different pantheons, Pretty simple. A high fantasy open world, filled with different types of mythological monsters for the player to fight and tame. From Dragons to Griffons to Cyclops and Medusas. Monsters have unique types, sizes and species.   The player also owns a sort of academy where monsters can be trained for different purposes. Monsters can develop new traits and relationships with one another (maybe even procreate?)   Your academy needs to be maintained&amp; upgraded. You need money, either from hunting down monsters (Contracts), selling monster parts or selling trained monsters (auctions)   Different monsters require different methods to train, based on their size, type and species. Some need new amenities and structures to hold them and "re-educate" them. The more monsters you train, the more reputation you gain, the more contracts and missions you get. You also unlock new clients and relationships with monster types.
hgvzj3, Idea for a moba character, I was thinking of a character that can take control over an enemy and maintain control until that target dies. It wouldn't be able to do anything without a host, wouldn't deal dmg, have low mobility, but it could become invisible or camouflage itself. The idea is inspired from starro the character from  DC Comics. I know it would be pretty boring for the player who's character gets infected since they would be spectators for a while so I was thinking that maybe it would drain hp slowly, eventually killing the target. Opinions?
gw03o5, Classic Joust brought to VR. A first person 3d battle royal platformer., Maybe throw in a simple bumper like lance so you can fend off dive bombers with one arm while steering your ostrich with the other. The floor is, of course, lava.
gzxmm2, A souls-like kart racer, Idk it just sounds like a funny idea. You can develop on it if u want idc.
h96jkb, AAA game request, [deleted]
gziskd, an idea for a roblox platformer, a game like mario 64 or roblox 64 but you have to complete stages to learn moves  the moveset for xbox (because its simpler to map it out on xbox in my head) a to jump b while standing still to punch b while moving to do the thing in sm64 where you can do a little hop in a sliding animation. and b while jumping or jumping and moving to do a kick.  x to dive while jumping otherwise it will be a dash.  right trigger to crouch and right trigger and a to do a dash jump.  you should be able to climb poles and grab onto ledges and wall jump.  also it should use the players avatar.  try and make some fun levels where you have to get to the end to unlock different abilities and then use them in the next level.  at the end maybe have a creator? so you can make levels and have other people play them!  also when you slide make it like the crouch hop thing!  also pls credit me if you do because ive always wanted to have a game like this!
h0vfyo, A New Direction For SAINTS ROW., Saints Row has always been about playing a ridiculous character in a ridiculous world, and I'm sure a lot of people find that entertaining but I also think when everything is ridiculous it doesn't generate a whole lot of investment in what you're doing besides dumb fun. Saints Row 4 basically made you a god. Unless they decide to take you out to space or something, there's literally nothing for them to explore without running the risk of repeating themselves and becoming creatively redundant.  So, I think some fundamentals need to be changed. Games like GTA are becoming increasingly zany whilst keeping many of its more serious elements in play. And the more that that happens, the less unique SR becomes.  So here's what they should do. The experience of SR should mirror GTA, but where it's different is that GTA is *Goodfellas* or *Scarface,* and Saints Row is *ONE PUNCH MAN.*  The world has problems, and its people don't have any solutions or are too inept or too politically correct to handle the situation. Enter, you. You are a ridiculous character who at every point of the campaign is entering into realistic, serious situations with batshit solutions that end up succeeding. The thing is, your solutions *shouldn't* have succeeded, but they just do, because you either have incredible luck or some magic is involved. You're basically a ridiculous version of Ethan Hunt. Either way, the characters in the world absolutely cannot fathom how you are succeeding. It's reaction comedy at its finest.  An example.  &amp;#x200B;  Some terrorists have hijacked a plane full of people. They intend to crash it into a building causing even more deaths. The president has to make the tough choice to destroy it because negotiations have broken down. A person representing you steps in and tells the POTUS that they have just the man for the job.  CUT TO:  You diving out of a plane (ala Uncharted 3). You intercept the Hijacked plane in midair. You open the door which creates a vacuum, and a whole bunch of terrorists get sucked out. You kill some that are remaining. But in process the pilots are killed and you have to land the plane yourself. Against all odds, you succeed, but unfortunately, word got around about how the operation was carried out, how the pilots died, and because of the public backlash of your reckless methods, you're out of a job and you have to start from scratch.  A few months pass. The world has moved on, forgotten about you. You have spent every moment of that time at home with your girlfriend, the only bread winner. You don't know what to do with yourself anymore, until you find out she's cheating on you. You follow her, see her with her lover and you get angry. They run away from you and you go after them. Stealing cars -- in some cases jumping from car to car -- all to chase them down. And when you do. You beat the shit out of him and realize that you are a mess and need to be on a better path.   And this is just the tutorial.  As you go along, you make friends and gain riches and reputation. You're still doing a lot of the very, very *ridiculous* things that you do in SR games, but the activities are more grounded, more relatable, and less frivolous than before. The ridiculousness, coupled with the world's reaction to you, is where the brunt of the comedy will come from, but the characters in the world also have their own weight.
hatgdp, Can’t come up with a setting for a horror game. Help, Hello, i’m currently making a horror game that involves raccoon as a MC, 1960, 1990 time period and most importantly comics. And i can’t start making other parts of the games, before coming up with a setting for a gameplay.  I’ve looked a lot of retro places (comic stores too, but they are too boring, cafe, pizzeria etc) and i can’t seem to find anything that would take my attention. Help!
h9jdzp, Help me complete a game idea I have!, Here is my story line:  A five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus. His father was the first to die when the hospital was already full with people. His mother died a day after from sorrow, grief, and sickness. His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.  So I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother. An example might be the riots on the streets. Keep in mind that I have never made a game before, so please make it easy to implement!
hcwoha, My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?,  Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, "road to x" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.  Yes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.  Would anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus.
hdxt7y, Sub-classes that a druid could become/transform/evolve?, Hello.  I'm designing a RPG idea where it's extremely unlikely that you find someone exactly like you, so there will be a total of 400+ different classes and 100+ unique specializations, but the problem is... I have to name and characterize each one. It's a WIP, one day I'll get there. Thing is, I'm kinda stuck with the Druid class, so:   tl;dr - What kind of classes/specializations a druid could become?  Thanks for your time.
hh05i5, LGBTunator - A platformer where you play as a transgender superhero but the catch is the enemies you face are bigots. Each level has multiple zones which leads to a final boss who has kidnapped a member of the LGBT community which you must save. This app would raise awareness to the issues we face., 
hi4dfd, an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part., the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.  you start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.  in the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.  each element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.  in the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.  the weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.  the map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.  the idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!
h7cbcc, I don’t know what to write., I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

gzrwm4, [REQUEST] Meta horror game story, Meta horror basically is different from the usual scary theme and unexpected. Like, self-awereness, 4th wall breaking, and like i said, unexpected.  Also if you can, please keep it simple. A nice lore would be enough. I want to keep it expanding myself.   Some meta horror games do things like looking like an ordinary game and then slowly progressing into the horror.   If you still didn't understand, I'm perfectly sure there's a way better explanation.  Some examples of meta horror :  - Doki Doki Literature Club - Simulacra - Pony Island - Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion - I'mscared  Thank you!

hg8x2p, An RPG stat system., Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually   turn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells  in real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually  controlled. It is a PVP game.  &amp;#x200B;  Strength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)  Dexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)  Agility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)  Wisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.  Magic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)  Constitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).  Focus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.  Charisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.  &amp;#x200B;  Further Stat rules:  	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.  	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.  	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.  	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.  	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.  &amp;#x200B;  Notes:  	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no  	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.  	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one  		fights.  	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.  	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.  	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the  	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con.

gylgjc, utility escortees, a game mechanic to make escortees more interesting., so this mechanic is an idea to make escortees that are lovable due to gameplay mechanics.  so you're playing the game and you have a choice, you can take somebody with you, they have no combat abilities but they have other useful abilities like scavenging useful items or healing you automatically. they do have to be defended in combat but they will be made as non frustrating as possible because 1:they actually use a half decent AI or 2:they have little to no AI in combat and are limited to player commands like "follow me" or "stay here", follow me translating to follow a set distance behind the players back and stay here translating to stand completely still and do an idle animation. outside of combat just use a normal pathfinding AI that works well enough to keep up with the player, and tadaa, you have an escort npc that feels more like a helpful buddy than a burden.  what do you think of these ideas?
gwgp27, Any ideas for 4 players coop tactical fps?, So I always liked the pre-planning in the games for example. Payday2 getting ready for heists, SWAT4, getting ready to enter and clear all those buildings. I want to make a game like that with my friends but can't think of anything. If any of you wanted to help me or share something it'll be appreciated.  Thanks,
gya3rq, The Arena from spy kids 3, Imagine the giant robot battle arena from spy kids 3 as an actual game. In the film the robots are controlled through the players direct movements while standing on a platform where the robots head would be. This platform in a real vr game would be your play space. This concept as a simple 1v1 multiplayer melee combat game would be a perfect fit for VR. Clip for reference- https://youtu.be/xGugDtX55CQ
gy43ty, MMORPG but with Minecraft's destruction, So big open world but most stuff is procedurally generated but anything can be destroyed like in MC. Some places are fine tuned like big custom cities and stuff. But also you can leave the surface and go into space without any loading screens and go planet to planet kinda like No Man's Sky. Maybe have base building mechanics like ARK or Rust. Stuff isn't as easy to destroy like in Minecraft (as in MC there isn't actual base building and Raids and you just have to hide stuff).   - MMORPG - Infinite planets with main ones like Earth have specific places custom made - no loading screens (but can use lightspeed travel as a little loading trick)  - proper base building mechanics - maybe quests like in wow and dungeons - not everything procedural like in NoMansSky - everything destructible (maybe apart from custom dev made places) - maybe GTA V like mechanics so stuff collides with no meshing and vehicles run smooth  What'd ya think??
gyn3n8, Fighting Game meets Sandbox, "Every year, 16 towns compete in a fighting festival where only one becomes the champion. Every town should choose the most skilled fighter amongst them and send him/her to this annual tournament. The prize: money for the fighter and his town and eternal glory."      Okay my idea is basically a sandbox game, so you can customize about every detail about the fighters (skills, fighting styles, stats, body, weapons, traits, etc.). AND...it is like a god simulator, as you don't actually fight, you choose and edit the fighters and watch them fight, until there's a champion. I haven't thought about all the details and storyline, but I think you can grasp the concept.      Leave your opinion/critique/thoughts and let's upgrade this game idea together.
gv4cqz, Rigged bowling game, You are an owner of a rigged bowling alley, all you do there is rotating the track slightly so the bowler does not get a strike,  if you make it too obvious and the bowler notices or he gets a strike the game is over.   If someone makes something like this please notify me
gvq4mk, A Village Sim Where You Play As The Town's Sole Doctor, A game like harvest moon, or stardew valley, or my time at portia, only you are the town's doctor. You play as the Harvey of your village.  I am not sure if there is already a game like this but I haven't heard anything similar yet, however, as a medical student who likes village simulators, I think this would be fun, though I do not have any game design knowledge, so I decide to post this in here. I know there are limitations in this idea, and upon writing this, I can see it being repetitive, but this is why I'm not a game designer. You don't have to read past this part if the title alone inspires you (my ideas may not be feasible or good design-wise anyway), My only hope is that people with take care of this.  /// CORE MECHANICS --- You are the new doctor of a fairly modest town. Their opinions of you would be by your (the game dev's) mileage. But what is certain is that you have a modest clinic. Where you farm, fish, and mine for various things for your practice (i'd imagine the doctor's personality on this would be just full of exasperation of all the shit he is subjected to doing). --- Practice --- Patients will come to you for a variety of symptoms. You check for signs. (This could just manifest into a simple diagram, but better yet, through dialogue (and a quest checklist). Your job is to diagnose them (this could be a multiple choice, or you consult a reference handbook and check from there). You have a hand book of basic illnesses, and there are some(many) that overlap except for a key sign or symptom. Some signs need special equipment that can be bought, or cartable.  After which you cure them, either through dialogue options ("don't touch the peanut butter", or, "you should exercise") or through pharmaceutical means (this depends of your diagnosis), and because you are in a villager simulator, you are also in charge of the medicines. You can either craft them via farming/foraging, fishing, mining, or combat  You can sell over the counter/artisinal stuff of course, i think that is the main draw of village sims, making money.  --- Villagers --- I truly think this would be what will differentiate a typical hospital sim to a game with depth, relatable villagers where you buddy up and romance. I think we should address one thing that may make or break this idea. Death  I think it would make a great disservice if death is avoided. Yes, people get sick every time and get well every time, but sometimes, it is inevitable. For such reason, I think some villagers need a death date. Also, if we are talking about death, we are also talking about aging. Yes we can just let their ages remain as age is very hard program.. but I think one should give it thought.. Another thing to consider is heart event influenced illnesses, like obesity, depression/anxiety, bulimia/anorexia, etc. You will find some of them manifest symptoms in a cut scene and you diagnose them (not a cutscene), this diagnosis could be lifestyle related.. once you treated them, they will tell you something personal  Also, one should consider of once dispensability to one/a type of illness. E.g. that dude who likes to party often comes with an std, and gets treated. Those that work out a lot will have lots of sprains and broken bones. People with allergies often come with checkups for allergies. Etc etc...  --- Misc --- •Id Suggest all items gathered (except rocks) are seasonal (except mining). Ingredients not on stock can be bought... some illnesses are more common in a season where the cure exist on autumn •A main story arc. (You are treating a sick patient, or you are trying to manage a pandemic stricken world... •diseases need not be real... the world can be a magical type of world...  Thank you for considering this idea and tell me what you think of it... is it too broad/complicated? How is its feasibility? And I hope this idea inspired you in a way ^^
gvg7ao, PvZ garden warfare but Pokémon, i have a game idea, This might sound pretty stupid but oh well here we go     The Name will be Pokémon Warzone, a 30 v 30 Third person shooter developed by Gamefreak and powered by frostbite 3     The Pokémon:   Every starter Pokémon as well as its evolutions will be available playable with their own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses including Type advantages  Each Pokémon will have 1 Primary move as well as 3 special moves that will have a cool down   for Oshawotts primary move will Razor blade and his special moves will be Aqua jet, Water sport and Water gun.  Cosmetics will be available to earn as well to stylize the Pokémon look.     Gameplay:   The gameplay will be fast paced as players come head to head with each other, much similar to pvz garden warfare.      Some maps that could be in the game would be Castelia City, Viridian forest, Orange islands, Monostoke, Poni island coast and Mt. Coronet to name a few ideas.      *Gamemodes* Takeover: Capture as many flags and K.O. other pokemon to bleed out the enemy teams score until the counter reaches 0    Team K.O: K.O as many pokemon as possible until the kill counter reaches 150 or more if its a custom server   Payload: One team pushes a payload while another defends and prevents them from reaching the end     Destroyable environments: Remember how i said that this game would be powered by frostbite 3, well this will be used for destroyable environments from small houses to triggering avalanches and skyscrapers collapsing      anyways this is just a little idea i have that might not ever happen in a million years
gw0aw8, Lion's Pride type game, There was a game in 2009 about lions that had a really cool mechanic. I used to play it all the time but it went off the market in 2010s era, and I have yet to see something that has the same style. There is a link at the bottom that shows some of the gameplay.  Essentially you play as a lion in a top down view of a savannah. You have a hunger bar that will go down, and cubs you must feed. Animals will enter the screen and your job is to draw a path towards the animal to catch it. Larger animals will require more than one lion to take it down. Overall I think it was a super addictive game and I can see it being fairly easy to program the ai.   I do not believe this is a violation of rule 2, as this game no longer exists. It is impossible to find, and the company no longer exists. I am also not aware of any ios or andriod game that currently employs this mechanic, so as far as I know, it would not be copying a game that exists on the market.   To avoid any copyright issues (though this game has been off the market for over ten years and the company that made it went bankrupt) maybe you could make it into a gladiator arena where people are top down fighting? Or perhaps you could even just make it into a wolf game?   If anyone made this game I would be willing to pay money to buy the app. This was one of my favorite games as a kid and it's been bothering me that I'll never get to play it again. I seriously encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to make the game, and if you make it, I will be the first to buy it. See? You would even be guaranteed a customer lol.  In all seriousness though, check out the links of gameplay. There seems to be some demand for a game like this in the comments of the first video.

gw0ttd, Mobile game idea that each match takes 1-5 mins?, 
gwpma3, A game mode where Tf2 and Overwatch fight each other., I know there are people who work for Blizzard or Valve on Reddit so yeah. Anyways, think about it, since overwatch and tf2 are basically the exact same thing, there wouldn't be too much of a clash. Since tf2 only has 9 classes, you would need to take the characters that are the same from overwatch. I'll go by order in tf2:  Scout : Tracer  Soldier : Pharah  Pyro : Mei  Demoman : Junkrat  Heavy : Bastion  Engineer : Torbjörn  Medic : Mercy  Sniper : Widowmaker  Spy : Sombra  This is just a thought, also I saw it in my dream. These characters go so well together that it's almost meant to be. Obviously you can switch around who you want to be, just like team Red or Blu, Tf2 or Overwatch. And the characters too. I know there are characters that are alot better than the ones alike, but if lets say Wrecking Ball when into his ball form, he is pretty fast and only scout would be maybe able to chase him down. Also this game mode will be in both games. I have zero experience with game design, and I know it's difficult to animate, but it would be a really cool gamemode to say the least. Oh and this time you have a choice for the entire server if you want infinite ammo or not. Maybe a vote every game? Anyways, just wanted to put this idea out there.
gv2ezj, Looking for a good storyline., I’m not a good story writer but the story need to be non intrusive and not too complex but intriguing.    So far I have the player gets kidnapped and escapes but wants to get revenge. This is a Co-op game 1-4 players.    Also this is planned to have a PC, mobile, and if possible a console release if that helps any.    Also you will get credited for any help you do if your idea goes into the game so if you want to be credited post or DM me how you would with to be credited idc if it’s funny or serious.   Thanks in advance.
gvgcso, Hunting sentient aliens while living in a van, Hello i just joined and this idea made me look for a place to share it and hopefully someone  or a group of peaple can make it a reality someday.  Story : A game where the world is being watched by evil aliens secretly and some of them are in human suit to spy and find more information about humans , the character you play knows about them and lives in a van with his good dog , you fight a long battle with aliens till you find out you yourself are a half alien half human so you question yourself who to side with the humans or aliens in the end.  Gameplay : 3rd person over shoulder open world game where you try to stop aliens from taking over the world and find there Hiden headquarters on earth and find the bad guys who are in direct contact with aliens by using melee weapons + guns and your alien abilities, you still have to live like a normal human so you have to make money by fishing or delivering packages safely to there destination across the map or just selling some alien tech to a scaintist , you move from place to place using your van so you have to constantly make sure there is inough gas and resources like food and drink in it and keep upgrading it to make fighting aliens easier for yourself.
gv2zhr, Jumanji concept for a video game, Hello, I think that main idea of jumanji (cartoon series and movies) is very cool, what if we'are thinking about concept of falling into board/arcade game? The game could divide into two parts: real life ( room of main character for example) and "jumanji" world where you could fall into and get task to return. I suppose that game world should be not random-generated but it may has many things that changes on any new "falling" into game world. What do you think about it and you have some mechanics for this concept?
guekc0, I need ideas for a Survival game any ideas, I am a game maker and I want to make a Survival games and my ideas that you can push over to me so I can spin ideas for the game
gtq2uc, [REQUEST For Ideas] Police Raid minigame, I am working on a minigame for a project and can't quite get the mechanics to work out.      So this video   [https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc](https://youtu.be/cZ8B-0esOoc)   shows what I have so far but it's in a very early stage and needs an explanation.     There are a bunch of criminals in a house and you are executing a raid. You can place a bunch of officers who will chase the criminals through the house as the criminals try to escape (Criminals Escape = You Lose)     Problem is - Right now it's very boring and easy to lock off the exits, so I need help figuring out how to give the criminals an advantage
gy6ny5, Question: how do the flairs on here work?, There is literally 0 explanation other than, "going to the wiki" which I have no idea how to get to.
gy4m75, A game where you're in an average setting and defending in average ways against any kind of horrible threat, Forgive the roughness of the title but I had an idea where you set the player in an average enviromment and background, like a clerk at a gas station or liquor store at night, and there is some kind of horrifying threat, like zombies or a monster or a masked psycho, but only with whatever is in the location. The beginning would set the scene, getting on shift or coming home late, and there would be some kind of announcement or an initial jump scare encounter to get things going. From then on it would be similar to CoD zombies where you are running around the location trying to erect barricaded and defend yourself. However, what would amp up the suspense and terror would be close encounters where the threat almost makes it through. The main point of the game is the stress of managing defenses and minimizing encounters with the threat. Then, I think the end would be based on the number of encounters or unattended barricades and have the threat breaking in and end in a chase with what would seem like the chance of getting away or having it end ambiguously.   If anyone is interested, let me know and if you run with it, I'd like some kind of credit.
gwn13h, An increasingly difficult puzzle platformer based around the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.,  You play as Orpheus just after Eurydice has been taken to hell/Hades. Your goal is to travel deeper and deeper into hell to rescue her and finish the song that will bring the world back to life (the plot is basically Hadestown with the possibility of a happy ending)  The gameplay is similar to games like Celeste with the hard-as-nails platforming but with some more puzzles worked in via a mechanic based on Orpheus’s gift from the gods: his ability to sing and have the world sing back. Throughout the game you’d learn new songs to make different bits of nature grow, shrink, move, etc. Since you go deeper and deeper into hell each level, the nature becomes more sparse and you must learn to adapt or make the most out of your songs using very few pieces of said nature. Each song you learn along the way will contribute to the final piece of music that Orpheus writes to bring the world back to life in the final level, wrapping this game up with an unexpected happy ending to a historically tragic tale.
gv0jg2, Robinhood game,       I think new Robinhood game would be amazing and heres why(kinda baked so bare w/m here XD). Imagine strolling down the streets of Nottingham, running around gaining info on possible treasurey wagon runs, looting gaurds of the money the stole from the people. All with the same gameplay style of Horizon Zero Dawn with the bullet time dogde of max payne. Can't tell me dodging out the window like the new movie wouldn't be insane.
guvwzc, Flat Fallout, Imagine you and some other players were in a flat area with nothing to do but run and jump. Soon, you would see terraforming occur. Not only that, but there are animals, weapons, and competitions spawning everywhere. This is Flat Fallout, a game that starts out simple but becomes hectic in your race to be the only person left in the game. Use weapons to crush opponents, battle in competitions for rewards, or wait for a lucky event.
gueyd0, A first-person colony management game, similar to RimWorld, So a few days ago I got RimWorld and I haven't slept since. I don't usually like singleplayer games but I have loved the grittiness of managing my own colony. RimWorld is an excellent game. I'm also a fan of first-person building games like Rust and Conan Exiles, and I started to wonder how I could combine the two into a first-person colony management game. This would be an ambitious project which I am not yet ready to start, but if I were to do it, I would want to do it the best way possible.     I think the first-person aspect would not only immerse the player but give them the feeling of being able to see objects/buildings/their colony up close and get the feeling of "I made this." There's also the ability you get in first-person to interact with the world yourself instead of watching your pawns do it, like watching an ant farm.     Here are some concerns that I have thought of:  * Should it be fully first-person? Should you be able to zoom out and see your entire colony from a top-down view for construction or battle strategy, or should you be stuck in first-person? I think a top-down view would be nice for planning and creativity, but it almost negates the immersion you get by playing a first-person game. Maybe there could be a mechanic that allows the player to see their entire camp to plan, like a mapping table? * Should you only be able to control one player, the leader, or should you be able to control any of your colonists at any time?  * Should you be able to stop/speed up time? This would only be applicable if there were some camera options other than first-person available. I can also see this being a problem if multiplayer were introduced, which I will address later. * Would it be fun? Perhaps the most important question- would chopping down trees, building a colony, defenses, hunting, and fending off attacking raiders be entertaining? * Death: do you respawn or control a different colonist? I would lean toward the respawn, but maybe have a permadeath mode where if you die you have the option to spectate your colony, but they will die without a leader.  Some challenges that I can see:  *  In my opinion, games are always better together. Multiplayer would be difficult to implement. If co-op were introduced, how would multiple people manage the same colony? A solution would be to just have multiple colonies, with a separate player controlling each. This opens up a whole new can of worms- the server architecture could quickly become a nightmare. * The AI would be a challenge to make- it needs to be smart enough so as to not be enraging. This is more an issue of my competence when it comes to creating systems, though.  What do you think? I'm sure there's lots I've forgotten.
gufwae, Parkour 1st person shooter, So basically like the movement off dying light or mirrors edge mixed in with call of duty so theres more levels to skill in movement it would even be good as a battle royal
