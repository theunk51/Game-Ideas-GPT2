ocp58w,You play an invisibly small alien visiting Earth's past battlefields. You must change history by slowing time, grappling onto arrows/bullets mid flight and steering them where they do most damage. You can hop from one to another once you've altered its trajectory or...,...you can stay attached and use the grappling lines to charge up the shot for different effects like sonic-boom (deafens enemies in earshot along its path causing them to drop weapons and clutch bloodied ears), hollow-point, explode-on-impact, ignite-on-impact, pierce (let's you shoot through one enemy and out into another) etc etc
ocqly5,A Life Simulation game where the society is created by the players.,The game has 32-Bit Graphics that aren’t restricted to the oversized pixels.  The setting is confusing cuz the cities look futuristic and there are some futuristic technology things (like teleporters that you can change the location to where you want to teleport to), but besides that, everything else is current society stuff. There are farms and beaches and mountains and forests that look normal and stuff. Also don’t know whether to have a generic map for each island, or have each island be randomly generated, or just have a whole, randomly generated, pretty much infinite world.  Anyway, the idea is, it’s an online multiplayer game. You have 3 life slots. When you start a life you can change how you look, and you can choose the colors of what your 3 sets of clothes look like. You are also given a phone (with many cool features, like texting, a camera, and an app store where you can install player-made apps (somehow, I have no idea how that would work, probably shouldn’t be an idea, but would be cool)), a certain amount of money or whatever, and... that’s it. I guess. Anyway. you choose where you want to start, and, I mean, I have been focusing more on the city part for ideas, but pretty much, it is a player-made game. All of the food you eat is from players that are farmers and stuff. And all of the companies are player-made. I have way too many cool features in my head, but yeah. Your whole experience is player-made. Anyway, each city will have 256 blocks, and each block will be 16 by 16 lots, but there are 6 levels. They aren’t just skyscrapers, they kind of form a pyramid. It’s hard to explain. Anyway, each lot will cost some amount of money based on how close it is to the ground and city center, and yeah.  The chat can be that you can choose a generic voice or literally record every sound in the text-to-speech thing with your own voice if you want. The main feature will be voice-to-text-to-voice chat. You can still be walking and not have to type anything. You just hit the chat button and record yourself, check if it says what you want it to say, and send. And then if you want in settings you can have it so that it only goes to text instead of voice, but voice will be default, because then it can be based on how far you are from the talker, and, you get it. Awesome, right?  Also, you have a hunger bar, a stamina bar, a happiness bar, and an overall health bar. If your health goes to zero, you die, and that life is lost along with all of the stuff and accomplishments you’ve had. I was also planning on having realistic sicknesses in a decently simple way, and you need to maintain a decent diet and stuff with nutrients, cuz the food has that stuff. Heck, maybe the food can even have a likability stat that tells how likely it is that your character likes it. The more a character hates a food, the more their happiness will go down, and vice versa.   Maybe I’m going a little too far, but I am an idea machine right now lol.  I have way more ideas for this game, but I can already see the top comment saying “Really cool idea, but from a realistic view, you’re asking for way too much.” I get that, but I just wanted to share it :)
ocsfeg,Potential game mechanic?,I had a random thought, would it be possible to make it so that an rgb keyboard could be use as a quick time mechanic? Light up  a key instead of an on screen prompt  I don't know how it would be implemented or developed, but I think it would be an awesome way add  something new to an rpg or even shooter.
oct7j6,First Person Twist,This is totally not becoming a game, but just wanted to say cuz some features are interesting for ideas for different games maybe.  Pretty much, it’s round based, and it’s multiplayer and there are different maps. You just want to get the most kills out of everyone, but you start with no weapon. Around the map there are many different things that might seem like background stuff for decoration, but you can use them to hit and throw at people and kill them. It’s like using everyday objects to kill people.  This next part will be a little bit of a reach, but maybe there are NPCs that if they notice you are dangerous can call 911, and if you don’t kill them before they call 911, the police will come and try to arrest or kill you.  Also was thinking of random power-ups that are cringy references, but that’s just me.
octjpf,Weird Survival Game,This is a game that, honestly, I have thought up more of the story than the game, but you guys can give me ideas for actual gameplay.  The game is called Coma. You are living in an apartment in a big city. You girlfriend has gone off to work, and you are staring out the window thinking. Just thinking. I forgot why, but you are suspicious of one of your coworkers.  All of a sudden someone tries to chokehold you, then there is some sort of fight scene, and if you manage to get to the last part without failing, you are in the kitchen grabbing a knife. You can sense that the are about to try to hit you with something. If you are frame-perfect, the game ends lol (just for speedrunners i guess lol). But if you fail...  You wake up in a forest. You see on one tree a sign that says “7 Days”. And then it gets blown by the wind into the sky. You have 7 in-game days to survive in forest. Somehow you have to collect certain things in order to climb up a tree that has a book at the top. It simply says “You are done”. And then you lose your balance and fall. In the air, the book if falling with you. If you manage to grab it before you hit the ground, you float into the sky...  You wake up in a hospital bed with your girlfriend next to you. The nurse says that you were in a coma. Your coworker was the man trying to kill you in your apartment. After that experience inside the coma, you appreciate nature and the wilderness much more, and after you recover, you and your girlfriend move deep into the forest.  This is so dumb, this is more of a Wattpad story than a video game idea, but yeah the gameplay parts are the interactive cutscenes and the survival in the wilderness. Maybe there are bears and stuff, and you have to craft stuff in order to find the stuff in order to craft the thing that helps you climb the tree? I don’t know, but that’s all I got. Any ideas?
octo4z,A party game that can totally ruin friendships,It’s called Opinionated. 10 players are sitting at a ring-shaped table. Each round, the players are given the same question, formatted like “What is your opinion on _________?” People write their opinions in 30 seconds, and then each opinion is displayed, but it does not show who said which opinion (to combat bias against a player). Each player has to choose which opinion was their favorite and least favorite. The player with the opinion with the lowest score is eliminated. This goes on until there are only 2 players remaining. In this last round, it goes the same, except the eliminated players vote on which one is their favorite. The person with the highest score wins :D Pretty much, it’s a game to see how easily you can offend your friends, and it can definitely make you lose them!
ocv2zs,UFO Investigator RPG/Survival Horror game idea,Not sure if this has been suggested here before but I have been watching the X-Files recently and this has sort of popped into my head. It'd be cool to have an RPG/survival horror game where you play as an agent of a shadow department (i.e one that doesn't officially exist) where your purpose is to investigate UFO cases, abductions by the entities involved with them, etc, etc. A puzzle aspect of the game could figure quite heavily in the form of trying to piece together evidence, there could be double agents within the department from other departments trying to sabotage your progress with misinfo etc, etc.   You could have a range of classes focused on different strengths, for example it'd be intriguing to have a class option for someone gifted with extra sensory abilities, one with a strong background in forensics and maybe something more combat focused. Just to give three potential examples.   I know this is pretty brief and rushed out but does anyone have any thoughts?
ocxexw,Under Fire,A turn based game, in which you play as a firefighter trying to put out fires. Before the match starts there is a planing phase in which players are told where the fire will start and spread to next turn. Players are then tasked to put out these fires and save civilians with limited resources and turns. The game will start with simple kitchen fires, but progressively get more difficult like an entire house fire to a fire in a high skyscraper. Then it becomes super over the top and you gotta stop a volcano or something. You’ll level your firefighter as you play, getting better gear and better abilities that fit your play style. It could be played alone or up to 4 player co-op. There could even be a versus mode in which a player controls the fire and another player(s) tries to put it out.
ocyjv7,UVB-76 : You are a Soviet radio operator tasked with decrypting radio messages for the spy networks and nuclear operations.,**Plot:** UVB-76 nicknamed "The Buzzer", is a real life Russian numbers station. It's thought to give radio commands to spies and agencies spread out through the sphere of Russian influence. The player is a Soviet radio operator tasked with decrypting messages.  **Audio files:** The game dev could source sound samples directly from sites dedicated to recording them: https://priyom.org/military-stations/russia/the-buzzer  https://www.youtube.com/c/HuyVuVan2005/videos  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7qTzgD6MTY  **Mechanics:** The game will centre around first by jotting down message using a table of russian letters, then "decrypting" the audio message into command codes. Then transferring the message to command and operatives according to procedure. The real life messages are known to follow a set structure that can be relied upon, and the player can be rewarded/penlised for how accurate they are. The dev or other players provide the "expected"   **Aesthetic:** In the style of a spooky Papers Please, and follow a gradual story progression as the truth is discovered.

od28ij,Terminator: Endwar,RTS Terminator game similar to Command and Conquer/Halo Wars, set after Judgement Day. Play as Resistance Factions and slowly take over the map one sector at a time. Invest in Research projects to unlock new devastating weapons, as well as hack Terminators for your own use.
od5sm6,Viva Pinata 3,When is the internet gonna get Rare to make another Viva Pinata? It's been 23 years, Rare, just give us the game we all want. Imagine having underwater pinatas to care for and a bunch of new land and air animals as well. There could be cosmetics, new shops, new terraria modifications, BETTER MULTIPLAYER!!! I will not allow myself to die before this game comes out, if ever. How do you feel about another Viva Pinata game?

odc9j4,Looking for some criticism and ideas for my NSFW game!,I'm currently working on writing a NSFW twine game with a medieval theme. It's going to be low-fantasy, with subdued magic elements and a dark vibe as well as lots of fetishes. I've kind of hit a writers block and am curious to see what people think so far, what they've got for ideas, and whatever else in regards to input they'd have. So here's a general idea of what I have so far. All feedback is appreciated!   About you, the player:  You grew up in the walled city of Agara, and have never left. The outside world is unknown. Rumors speak of larger cities and unspeakable horrors that lurk in the forest. You are 18 years old now and have always been on your own. You've lived off the streets as a beggar. You had a family once, but your parents mysteriously disappeared when you were 5. You have no family here and are completely alone.   The City of Agara (uh-gar-uh)  Description:  The city of Agara is a small, walled city built in the hills of the grass lands just outside the forest. Most notable for its scenery and smell, Agara houses lots of wood fires, creating a very smokey and well-lit impression. Homes here are primarily built of wood and stone; the poor live in shacks of low quality wood, whereas the rich live in homes of cobblestone and durable, stripped wood. Due to this construction method, fires are very prevalent here, mostly due to drunken mistakes.   Laws:  The city is controlled and governed by a counsel of people. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to leave the walled city of Agara for safety reasons, as enforced by the counsel. Those who commit crimes too severe for pillory are banished from the city or tied and left in the forest, regardless of age.   Locations:  The Jelous Mug - Tavern; The only tavern in Agara, and a local favorite for eating, drinking, and sleeping.  Unnamed Location - Public Bathhouse; The newest building in the city. With the abundance of wood sourced from the regions forests, fires could be made to warm waters for public bathing, keeping people from bathing in nearby waterways used for drinking water.   Notable Occupations:  Carpenter   The Monsters:  Humans - people are unpredictable  Orc - a byproduct of dark magic  Vampyre - thrive in the darkest depths of large cities  Lycan - much like vampyre, they are humans inflicted with a curse that is said to have origins that trace back to the elves.  Minotaur  Centaur  Elves - Extinct, along with magic itself. Elves grew too powerful for their own good, and it ultimately caused their demise ( a civil war called the war of the gods )  All monsters pose a threat to you outside of walled locations. ( Vampyre, Lycan, and Humans can still be found inside of walled locations )   As mentioned above your parents went missing when you were just 5 years old. Hints and clues found while playing will lead you to an unnamed extremely powerful entity which I will refer to as "the dairy". A place that farms humans and creatures for a profit. (milking and breeding them etc.) This place will reveal their fate. You the player can be captured or sold to the dairy before finding clues in the game based on your actions.   Misc Notes:  In this game world the passage of information is very poor, as news and communication only travels by mouth, courier, or birds.   Planned "Goals" for in game:  Find the fate of your parents  Stay Alive as long as you can  Work for money and achieve great wealth buying awesome things'
odcfh1,A Free Roam Venom Based Game,A Game where you play as a Normal Dude, but you can instantly swap to something like Marvel's Venom (the swapping mechanic could be like the one in Spider-Man: Web of Shadows)  The Story could be like a Playable version of the Venom Movie   Now, Have a Good Day/Night'
oddv77,The world is in desperate need of a game where you play animals in a medieval setting,It doesn't matter if it is fantasy or not, but for example, I think a game where you and your buds, as wolves, raid a human's wagon on a road. The humans could be AI or normal people But I think It would be incredibly fun, especially sense there could be birds or rats in city biome and larger animals or even herds of bison in the wild's. Basically the isle with normal animals and humans in an era were animals could actually compete with us, and often win. I think the world just needs more survival animal games in general though because they're so much fun and it's still a pretty new genre!'
ode7ay,Mechanics ideas for current game,So I have a locomotion setup I need ideas to slow down the player as he/she attempts to reach end checkpoint. I have security cameras that close exits to your current room when detected, which you have to find the control panel to unlock and door and temporarily disable cameras. I am already working on guards, so I need other ideas. The setting has yet to be determined.
odi4q7,My first concept,    My first concept. Please share your opinion and tell me how this concept could be improved.  *(Sorry in advance for possible mistakes in spelling, as English is not my native language)*   &amp;#x200B;  **Plot basis**   On December 26, 1991, Lenin wakes up in one of the Khrushchevka flat. In an attempt to prevent the collapse of the USSR, he moves between the rooms of a large and spacious Khrushchevka (about 14 rooms per level), using fists and improvised means, engages in battle with people who send both real personalities and characters from Soviet films and other fictional characters (for example Cheburashka). In the last room, a boss battle awaits him, after which, instead of preventing the collapse of the USSR, he is pulled to the upper floor (in the past several years ago). Each of the floors personifies a certain era of the USSR, depending on the ruler. And on every floor, Lenin is trying to save socialism. In the course of the plot, the player only has to find out why Lenin woke up in Khrushchevka, and what awaits him on the top floor when he gets to 1917 year.   &amp;#x200B;  **Genre**  Roguelike, top view, drawing - pixel art, soundtrack - sovietwave.   &amp;#x200B;  **References:**   Moving between paneled rooms in Khrushchevka flat as moving between rooms in "Binding of Isaac".   From the same Isaac, the idea of constant descent into the underground is reversed, since time goes in the opposite order, from the collapse of the USSR to its appearance, then Lenin ascends through the floors, and does not descend.   The combat system is similar to "Hotline Miami", in addition to fists, you can use improvised items, and sometimes firearms.   Also, as references for drawing, you can refer to such beautiful games as Noita or Graveyard keeper.  &amp;#x200B;  I would be glad to hear your opinion on the concept. Tell me what could be added to the game.
odiiz8,I an building a FFA shooter inside a game called Crayta. Any mechanic ideas?,My idea is a shooter where you collect 'energy crystals' which spawn randomly acrosd the map and the first player to collect 5 crystals wins. Crayta is an online platform like Roblox or Core. Does anyone have any ideas for mechanics?
odiors,New team for game devs( especially beginners )and i have some things for pros too.,[removed]
odj0yy,I was listening to Machine Head and Slipknot when I had an idea...,Action based game set in South America during the time of the conquistadors. From a once well established township, that has fallen into ruin due to small pox, a young lady, daughter of a shaman steps up for her people. He sends her on a quest to drive back the conquistadors on his dieing breath. (Small pox would be depicted as a curse brought on by the westerners.)     She heads through the jungle to the next nearest village/town that has apparently been ransacked. (insert combat tutorial vs wildlife). She would have eaten a hallucigen that the warriors in her tribe use before a hunt/battle. So the walk down would get progressively more distorted/trippy on her way. When she arrives at the village that is being occupied by conquistadors she sees (insert all horrible things they are doing) them as half man/demon things due to her hallucingens. Heavy metal music such as Slipknot - Distasterpiece type will be playing. Combat would be arena style very similar to Senua's Sacrifice as I feel the pacing and weight of it would suit the setting.  Exploration should be limited, giving the player a very linear path like Senua's Sacrifice, Tomb Raider, Uncharted to allow for set piece scenes and space for cinematic story. This isn't the type of game where you want your character to be running 24/7. Atmosphere is key. Running in combat environments, sure but otherwise no.  As the character takes the psychedelic warrior brew, the jungle will grow darker/more hellish as the character is NOT having a happy fun time. Whilst making the environment blurry perhaps, it should make entities/interactable items pop out, even maybe glow to represent the hyper focus from that state of mind.     In her journey she will have visions of her father guiding her, the environments get more and more surreal as the game goes on, it ends in her actually driving them back (alternate history much). At some point she finds a historic/legendary weapon. Keep time span of the story vague.  Every town can be approached with stealth or warrior smash style. Stealth involves sneaking and ranged weapons (poison blow dart? Bow?) and take downs and hiding the bodies. Some towns will be easier to stealth or to just leeroy.     Psychedelic drugs restore her health but here is the caveat. There are different endings, depending on if she took minimal amounts of psychedelics or insanely heavy amounts. The best outcome is she pushes back the conquistadors and made Queen or something for her efforts. The middle one, is she pushes them back, but her own people banish her at the end because she is too scarred from the experience making her violent/crazy. The worst outcome is that she took so much damage that she ignored during the playthrough that the moment she beats the last mission, she falls to the floor, dieing of her injuries.
odjdzx,Looking for a puzzle game idea,Anybody have an idea for a puzzle / strategy game?
odk90o,Word guessing game but with pronunciation,the gameplay goes so you would see a word but it's instead written how it's pronounced. For example,  Hello would be həˈloʊ and so on. I am still not sure what could make it more interesting and hope to get suggestions from the comments
ods2r9,How would you make a online flash game (not really a game idea rather just something I can never figure out a answer to),The closest I've seen is just slowing down other people, which really isn't ideal. But then again you can't actually just "make it" because that's you know.. impossible.
odszix,SMALL CREATURES survival game,all survival games need a gimmick dinosaur, post-apocalypse, zombies again.. and much more  but for the longest time, I have always wanted a survival game based on the creatures you would find in your back garden and living the hidden lives of those animals. I thought the idea of playing as an animal was dead in the water as for years nobody ever picked up the idea until The isle game along no doubt helped by the new boom in dinosaurs media. But unfortunately, bugs and little creatures aren't as interesting, and projects that attempt to make survival games based on such a premise but with arthropods as the main focus often get ruined. a few examples were insect kingdom where the dev demanded 100,000 to finish the game despite providing bare bones and in my opinion, unengaging and terrible game mechanics and Ant simulator which had all its funding spent away by shady people who apparently betrayed the lead developer.  &amp;#x200B;  apparently, the universe hates this idea but new hope came when I saw the trailer for grounded only to realize your not gonna play as bugs but a bunch of annoying kids. So you know what I'm gonna issue a challenge to develop a survival game set in the undergrowth WHERE YOU DON"T PLAY AS HUMANS but as insects hell at this point id be fine with playing as a rat.  And here are some ideas  1. don't make it a 3rd person game I know it's tempting but trust me making it 3rd person robs the game of its true scale. though this prospect might get confusing for walking up walls (which insects tend to do) don't worry Natural selection2 tackled this problem brilliantly where they fixed the camera of the player so they wouldn't be disorientated. If you want a terrible example of this look at alien vs predator and watch an alien playthrough (you might get motion sickness).  2. add multiplayer, why ? well, we already have singleplayer only games where you play as bugs deadly creatures, Badmojo, and others unless your game is gonna have a revolutionary groundbreaking story living in an empty world filled with bots is incredibly boring and your game will die.  3. add progression, whether it be insect growth to adulthood or possibly even upgrading your skills(possibly through an RPG system or skill tree) players need a reason to keep playing a goal to reach.  4. ACTUALLY RESEARCH INSECTS AND OTHER ARTHROPODS, there are so many interesting creatures out there that get left out because "we want big spider" or "ant cool" look at other creatures for example  dragonflies fast and quick aerial predators that can hover but as babies, they live underwater as predators, there are assassin bugs that literally collect hundreds of bug corpses on their backs as armor, there are spiders that can walk on water, the bombardier beetle can light an explosive reaction so hot it cooks ants alive, there are so many other gimmicks to add to make VARIED GAMEPLAY instead of "haha ant crawl up the wall".  4. ADD MOVEMENT OPTIONS, people love moving why do you think rocket jumping became such a beloved feature, bugs can fly run up walls dig underground, and jump.   5. you need bots, your game needs to be able to be fun even without a huge player base which unfortunately for a premise like this will probably be the case because pussies will be too scared to play because "spiders are so scary" so adding bot enemies like roaming spiders or an ant nest full of aggressive ants that players could raid is important.  so far these are my ideas and grievances with the genre I don't know if ill ever live to see such an idea happen since too many people think bugs are icky and would rather step on them than take the time to understand them let alone play as them in a videogame.
odu9kc,The walking dead: walkers world,The basic idea is that it's an open world extreme survival game  You create your own character and give them different attributes (similar to fallouts S.P.E.C.I.A.L system) with fitting choices to the world  and theme   The game would take place (if it were possible) a almost full scale America  Clans can be made  As well as camps/facilities which can be made with recourses found in the world  NPC's can be gained from helping them in cities etc. And gaining them to your base would be an option  If enough Npc survivors can be found you can start trading arrangements with other clans , but things can go wrong with these trips as they are Npc ran so natural occurrences could happen such as problems like walker attacks or other multiplayer people/ clans attack the vehicles the NPCs use   You could start trading gear with clans without using the game feature of using NPC's, for safer negotiations but the Npc trading drives are just to save the player time   Resources could be very hard to find but farming and engineering can be done by using either NPC's or using your characters own skills   Unlike later seasons walkers will be common to see as many games like dayz have zombies but they are never a threat due to them being mostly non apparent in gameplay   Eventually herds of walkers will start to appear but they will mostly be on highway areas   Walkers will mostly be attracted to players due to noise mostly game chat or gun shots   As places such as camps when so much game chat starts eventually walkers will be attracted  Cars will be a huge part of this game as unlike in most games storage is reflected in a realistic manner and travel will take long amounts of time travelling to long distance locations   Most if not all cars are fully built when a server is started but over time people will start taking parts such as tires and batteries, fuel will be hard to find (not as hard as dayZ as it's near impossible to use cars)   In gameplay unless NPC's or online players are killed in a head location they will eventually turn (online players won't have control of the walker version of them)   That's basically it, this is a game that would basically only be possible in a perfect world 😅😅 but it's still a cool idea I wanted to share please don't hate
odvfzu,Survival Horror Game Where You Get to do Actual Work,Okay, so this is going to sound a bit cliche but I have attached a link to this post which shows a demonstration of how a VR environment can be used  for work [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab\_channel=RedStapler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttrHWZVMugo&amp;ab_channel=RedStapler)  Now imagine if someone could implement a survival horror game such as FNAF where you have to stay in one place whilst also being able to interact with your work environment. Some problems of course would be trying to concentrate whilst also being on edge for potential jumpscares. But it was just an idea I would like to share.      If anyone has other ideas for VR office spaces it would be cool if you wrote them down below  Thanks!
odw6ys,Twitch enabled horror game,Just a stray 4th wall breaking mechanic that I just thought of, not a full scale idea.  A horror game, possibly concerning the ghost of someone your character killed (for whatever reason) that can detect if you're streaming the game and will join your twitch chat as a bot and haunt you with creepy messages that directly relate to your gameplay.
odybbb,Lucky &amp; Wild VR,Not sure if anyone ever played the old arcade game "[Lucky &amp; Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OOP-1WHSKE)" but it was a pretty unique arcade game that would be a great concept to port to VR.   The main player focuses on driving but also has a handgun to fight back if playing alone. The coop player sits shotgun and also has a handgun.  The VR version could expand on the abilities of the passenger. With a convertible that player could be launching rocket launchers out the roof.
oe12cr,Car-racing MOBA - Dream MOBA combination!,   Alright so here goes my concept of this game.  **Base game** \- Although it would have some futuristic elements, the game would feature open-world realistic elements, cars, destruction etc. Think of the base game as Forza Horizon 4 where the graphics are an eye-candy. So let's take Forza Horizon 4 as the base game.  **Let's add the MOBA flavor now** \-  1. The game would feature laps-based racing on various tracks (similar to FH4) 2. When a match is found, you'll select from a list of cars (similar to Champions selection screen in League of Legends or any other MOBA) 3. These cars have their own passive + 2 abilities + 1 ultimate. 4. The match could feature up to 10 laps (could be variable as per the "fun factor"). 5. When a lap ends, there will be a 15-second freeze (the screen would gray out), quickly giving you options to amp up your gear. The car at the first place would earn more gold than the others and so on. This would feature - a) Leveling up your ability (you can choose to level up one of your 2 abilities, or ultimate ability after the 5th lap) b) Adding a tweak to your car (handling, acceleration, transmission, top speed etc.) c) To give the trailing cars a chance, they will be given a package of nitro boost, with the car at the last place having the most nitro boost. Use the nitro wisely! 6. If you wreck another car during a lap, you get more gold! So even if you're at the last place, you have more chances to get gold, get stronger and push to the first place. 7. After the end of every lap, cars heal themselves with 500 health. 8. Cars also suffer collision damage (from other cars/environment) which means you would need to drive efficiently as well (duh! it's racing after all!). Collision damage from cars is called 'ram damage' = 100 damage (but can be modified by cars' abilities).  Win condition - At the end of the 10 laps or so, the car that crosses the finishing line wins!  **Game modes** \- Given this concept, the game could also feature- 5v5 team-based racing- Destruction derby  **Cars ideas** \- (inspired from Twisted Metal series)  **Spectre "The Special Weapon" (1200 health)**  Passive - Whenever Spectre is tail-gaiting behind a car, it gains a drafting boost, giving it more speed as the drafting continues.   Q (12 seconds cooldown) - Spectre goes in auto-pilot for 4 seconds taking full-control of the car. If in range of the car ahead, the auto-pilot would tail-gate to gain a drafting boost and fire a heat missile dealing 150 damage.   W (10 seconds cooldown) - Spectre fires a shock missile directly ahead hitting the first car and locking it's steering for 2 seconds. During this time the affected car cannot steer left or right.   Ultimate - Spectre fires a homing missile locking on to any target ahead of him and dealing 500 + 10% of the missing health as damage. A small HUD would appear to select a target car ahead of Spectre.  **Outlaw "The SWAT Unit" (1400 health)**  Passive - Outlaw can issue "tickets" to high speeding cars by ramming into them. If Outlaw rams into a car speeding over 60 mph (96 kph), it issues a "ticket". When a car stacks over 4 tickets, it suffers a sudden speed loss to 30 mph and is dealt with 200 damage.   Q (10 seconds cooldown) - When in range of the car ahead, Outlaw activates it's siren initiating a chase towards that car and gaining +20 mph speed. If Outlaw rams into the car during this time, it issues 2 tickets (can stack with passive).   W (9 seconds cooldown) - Outlaw throws a spike strip behind it's path. If a car runs over the spike strip, the speed would decay -20 mph/second for 2.5 seconds and dealing 250 damage.   Ultimate - Outlaw sounds a loud siren for 2 seconds after which all the cars speeding over 80 mph suffer a sudden shock, slowing the speed down by -40 mph, dealing 400 damage and issuing a ticket.  **Hammerhead "The Monster" (1800 health)**  Passive - Hammerhead has slower speed than other cars but +150 more basic damage (ram damage).   Q (8 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead throws a short-range hook directly ahead. If a car is hooked for 2 seconds, Hammerhead pulls it briefly before ramming into it (100+150 damage).   W (10 seconds cooldown) - Hammerhead extends out a long steel barricade for 3 seconds, attached to it's back preventing cars to overtake from left or right.   Ultimate - Hammerhead turns on the MONSTER mode for 6 seconds, gaining +30 mph speed, +400 ram damage on first hit. If the first hit wrecks the enemy car, an extra 2 seconds are added to the MONSTER mode.
oe24mw,Space-Prison Boss Rush,Okay so I really love boss fights in video games so I came up with a scenario where you literally just fight a bunch of bosses in a tournament. Here's my idea:  You have been falsely accused of treasonous acts against the supreme ruler of the universe. Your sentence is to spend the rest of eternity in the Void Colosseum which orbits around a black hole on the outskirts of the solar system. It is essentially a prison where the most dangerous of criminals are sent to fight each other in an endless tournament. The only way out is to make it to the finals and defeat the prison's most powerful opponent. The prisoners are affected by a curse that activates upon death. Their minds are sent back in time to before the fight they died in. You must fight against various monsters, bounty hunters, war machines, demigods, and interstellar beings to make your way up.  Since you are a normal human, you start off with zero combat experience. The most you are given is a dull blade and broken armor. As you fight and die, you gain abilities and combat experience. For example, successfully dodging enough attacks will increase the speed and distance of your dodges, and landing attacks with your weapon will eventually increase that weapon's attack power and speed. As you win more fights, the combatants will become increasingly harder to fight and you will eventually come across an unstoppable opponent who will effortlessly destroy you no matter how much skill you gained from previous fights. At this point, your only two choices are to fight forever, or try to find a way to break the system.
oe5hsk,A cactus rolling game. Sonic, in slow motion. Momentum conservation.,You play as a potted cactus that got stuck underground, and is trying to get to the surface.  The cactus part is sticky, and will attach to objects such as walls, etc... but the pot is not. So you need to gather momentum and keep that momentum in order to keep moving, otherwise you'll get stuck on your side and can't get back up.     It's basically slow motion sonic, but underground.   &amp;#x200B;  No enemies, except there are a bunch of mushrooms that want to be your friend and cheer you on. Little do the mushrooms know that they release poison spores that kill you (so you have to keep moving forward).   &amp;#x200B;  You have to avoid water because cactuses drown, and  you can stand in sun rays that pierced the surface in order to get a speed boost.   &amp;#x200B;  Only two commands. Jump, and roll.
oe5q3e,A Transformers themed battle royale,Simple concept, start as a robot (no vehicle mode) you have to scan a car to enable the vehicle mode.  the car form is your armour level, so bigger the vehicle the higher the armour, once the armour level is down to zero you have to scan a new car to re up your armour.  weapons can be found in drops.   upgrades or mechanics like pings/rader can be picked up and they get added to the model.  the "ring" could be the warp gate closing effect from the shows or maybe the rust stuff from the prime show  then obviously it's giant robots fighting destructible building's and terrain if on earth. but it would be cooler if it was on cybertron.   The style of war for cybertron / fall of cybertron
oe65s0,Open world history/mythology RPG,\*DISCLAIMER: I dont know if it's possible but if it is it will take a really long time\*  It's an open world and the map should be the earth, based on where you live is where you should start/spawn. You are going to choose between some classes (Like you do in WoW). The earth should have some houses where you can follow the main story but you can do other things like building your own house just like minecraft, you should be able to chop down trees, eiter the trees drop aplings so you can re-plant them or it could be on automate, dosen't really mather. But as it says in the title it should contain all mythology creatures from all the different countries. Like where i live we have something called Troll, it's a giant that lives in the forrest but if you go to the ocean you might counter the legendary Kraken.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope some people understand what type of game this is and i would love to make it but im really bad at programing.
oe9xzd,What flairs means?,
oehuzq,RPG with an unique TurnBase Combat mechanic.,**Hi everyone!** I'm currently making an RPG heavly inspired in undertale and earthbound and I need some help in the combat system. I have litteraly no ideas.   I want something unique that doesn´t feell like that the player isn´t playing another final fantasy.   I love the undertale mechanic but I want something different since the gamplay is already similar.   The person with the best idea will get his/her name in the credits :)    The story will be about demons or something, I can´t decide it yet.  &amp;#x200B;  PS: Sorry for my poor English, it's not my first language and I'm still learning :P **Thank you**!

oem8ef,Cool 2d visual novel concepts?,I got a new game engine that I’m excited to use but I have absolutely no ideas on what I should make. Any suggestions?
oen4di,A physics based combat game where different weapons have different scaling properties,For example, weapons that scale with Momentum would do more damage the faster they are moving. This would be really good for weapons like flails or whips. There could also be weapons that scale with Gravity and do more damage the farther they fall. For instance, if you did a plunging attack off a high building using a weapon with an S+ scaling in Gravity, you would just obliterate whatever enemy you land on
oenft8,County life or sheriff simulator.,I've had this idea for a while but haven't really obtained the skills to make a full out game. I personally grew up in a small town in northern Idaho. I understand some may think this is too big for an Independent dev, but I think some may want to attempt or take from my idea. I've always wanted to play a police simulator game based in a rural setting. I got the idea from playing my summer car a few years back. I thought how cool it would be to have a more in depth game that went over a sheriff's everyday life.  The game itself I don't think should be story driven but more decision driven possibly, but in depth enough with encounters that it keeps the player engaged.  A few things I think would/should be involved to make it more in depth are:  Don't make the player the actual sheriff, but make them the deputy or include multiple modes where you're the sheriff and are the shot caller, or you're the deputy and are on call;  Possibly involve two different difficulties, one with a food, water, health, etc. and another without such for the players that just want a police simulator; Multiple towns, I think two - three small towns with 5 to 10 minutes of modest driving in between them would give it that county/rural feel, especially with a logging area and a few farms along the way; Housing, I think a few options with rent to pay would give it a good life simulation feel; Businesses, I think each town should have multiple businesses that each have wares for the players to buy, such as a diners, grocery stores, or gas stations for food. A dealership for personal vehicles. This can really go anywhere for businessess.  I have a few more ideas that I just think are personal wants, they may actually be useful for the game but I'm not too sure. I'm not too sure if this is too lengthy or something so I'm fully open to the negative replies but nonetheless if you need anymore reply, or add my Snapchat to talk privately :shawnoe32
oeq1il,Football manager style wrestling management game,I'm certain someone already posted this at some point. But does it exist? Something like hiring wrestlers, managers, doctors, refs, booking matches,  booking venues, custom wrestling promotion style, custom belts/championships/tournament/PPVs, long and short term storytelling, match/performance rating system, wrestlers compatibility. stealing talent, loaning talents, contract negotiations, tv ratings, PPV buy ratings, and stuff like that. Like a football manager but for wrestling.
oeqyz4,A hypothetical game idea,I've been pitching a game idea for months for a world building project made by C. M. Kosemen and Simon Roy called "A World of Dinosauroids." I was very fascinated by the amount of lore of this world building project that I can't help but think what if there would be a game based on it.  My hypothetical game would be a survival game that takes inspiration from Subnautica and Death Stranding.  I can't list everything I have in my mind otherwise I would be writing a whole bible so I might want to make multiple parts based on the basic game mechanics for like maybe every 4 days or I'm gonna make weekly updates for my ideas.   Anyways. What kind of game would you design based on this project? Let me know! I'm eager to hear your thoughts and ideas in the comments!  Heres the link to the website:  [A World of Dinosauroids](http://cmkosemen.com/dinosauroids.html)

oetpqz,Guys I am making a game please tell me how it is. Please. Will it be fun? Please tell me what do you guys think?,This is a 2D top-down stealth game. This is not a platformer. It is level based. There will be different chapters and in each chapters, there will be a number of levels. We play as [Bubo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xn0WVS3mZ4c5ljg-I7bxpWRqq-Ls9qnB/view?usp=sharing) a small slime like creature(maybe I'll change his appearance to something better). Our objective is to save [Gugy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWWhPnI479KluPpqDWSmRR-5r3PWtHrx/view?usp=sharing) (who is bubo's girlfriend) from other "evil qunos". Qunos is their species name. There will be ghost qunos, ninja qunos, bomb qunos.. etc as enemies. Each enemies will have special powers. For example, ninjas can throw ranged weapons etc..  Evil qunos will be travelling along a path, guarding a key to the next room(level). We should stealthly move throught the level and take the key and escape the to the next room. Our enemies can't look back. (Like in pacman) There are things in the level to distract them. And there will be teleporting points in the room to teleport to another point in the room.   These are my current ideas. Do you guys have any recommendations or ideas for any addition features? If any, then please inform me. Pls Pls Pls

oexs34,Director of Funball - football management with pirates!,Hey!  I'm a Football Manager fan but I've always got a bit bored with all of the actual football and wanted to play a game that was more fun and focussed on the club building than the tactics of football.  So I decided to build it.   If I'm honest, had I known then what I know now I would never have started! But, I didn't know then what I know now and so I did start. 2 years (and quite a lot of money later) I've finished my first ever playable demo.  I'm now desperate for people to play it and let me know whether it's any good. And funny. It is supposed to be funny but I've spent so long looking at it that it is now the least funny thing in my life!  You can download a completely free demo here  [https://dofunball.itch.io/director-of-funball](https://dofunball.itch.io/director-of-funball)  I'd love to hear any and all feedback.  thanks
oeyrh2,This came to me in a dream- War Beavers,[Game Sketch](https://imgur.com/gallery/c4AhxBQ) Okay so basically, this is a mining/crafting battlefield game. At least, that's my original idea, but I also like the idea of completely scratching the war aspect and making it more of a multiplayer customizable game where you can craft new things for your own little beaver hut and invite others to your home. The graphics will be simple and 2d, with the bottom levels being water with floating hunks of elements like iron and coal to mine.
oeyzad,Chao garden mobile game?,I had a loose idea after watching a YouTube video, and all I got is a chao garden from the sonic series on your phone, cause chao are cute, and who doesn't love cute?  I imagine it would be a combination of maybe gacha and puzzle levels to obtain items to give chao, or to get new chao in general.   Could also be a Mario run style platformer where you can run one way and can take multiple paths to get all the items in a level. If it's actually sonic, and not a knock off or custom made series, I think this would work well enough. Not to mention, you could unlock multiple characters to run through levels.  Again, loose idea, and wanted to share it somewhere, and here seemed like the best place to do so.   Sidenote : I am not a programmer or developer of any kind, just have random ideas :)
of38lz,Daredevil game where you *as the player* are blind.,This would be unlike any other game and it is stupidly easy to mess it up but it could be amazing if executed right.   In fairness the player would be able to see while free running and in cutscenes. Free running would be based off a much tamer world on fire perspective we saw on the show while cutscenes would just be standard cutscenes.   Combat is where things would go black, not completely black as you will visual UI, indicators to help inform the player, and some very archaic visuals just to give players a small amount of context of where they are, add on some brightly colored intractable objects to give the game sleeping dogs.  Outside of visual indicators audio queoes will be the bulk of combat challenges, this may sound simple but you can add depth to it and make it an original type of fighting game. Of course the sounds will be heavily overdone which actually fits the daredevil lore. A knife for example will make a very specific sound once a guy is about to attack you, a visual indicator will show where the attack is coming from, and then you'll need to use the dodge mechanoc to avoid the attack, add on other mechanics like guns and enemies throwing objects and tough guys and there could be a lot of challenge coming from combat that is 90% audio. Visual,  Beating heartbeats will be shown to tell the player where enemies are in relation to them and a heartbeater counter as UI will tell them how many enemies there are to beat. The hearts will even start visible beating harder to show the player when they are about to go for an attack. Once the player finishes a fight we'll show them a replay of the entire fight but with actual visuals to let them see how much of a badass they really are, think superheat for this.  I know this entire game does sound convoluted and like I said it's VERY easy to mess up. But it has a lot of potential and could be really rhythmic and exciting if done well.
of4ptv,Racing Game Idea,So I've seen a lot of racing games, and none of them have what I want all in one, so I thought I would share my own idea. First off, we need a lot of cars. Like a lot. Next we need good customization for every or most cars, similar to nfs heat, but better. Next I want to include not only the option to race, but to just casually drive around too. We need lots of things to do, and we will need a big map. I'm talking 5 times as big as nfs heats map, and the option to download custom maps and races. Then we need a custom race track creator, and one that's really good too, and not like most custom map creation tools like Tony hawks pro skater games. Kinda like skyrim modding but in the racing game, where on PC there would be no big restrictions for assets, but on console only using assets the base game provides. And the most needed thing is a solid multi-player. We need many options for online play, racing, free driving, time trials, 1v1 races, battles kinda like Mario Kart (dunno how it would work yet) and the ability to play people's online maps with other people (kinda like team fortress 2 servers). This is just a rough idea, and I think it would all fit in to a game that's AAA. It would need lots of work to do properly too lol. Lemme know if this is a shit idea or a good one, cuz I have lots more to add. TL;DR: cool racing game with lots of customization and the ability to choose how you play easily.
of58w7,A glitchy AAA game, where you glitch between the years 1910 and 2070,Hi guys, I'm extremely new to game design, but I've been thinking about this one idea for my university project (I cannot express this enough, it will be snippets, and maybe you can roam around a room MAXIMUM)  What if, there was 1 constant game (story, NPC interaction, signage, map etc), but, one had the aesthetic of the 1910's, and the other in 2070.   E.g.   1910, french lady with a coffee smoking a cigarette 2070, new age zoomer with monster zero and a vape.  Signage, where 1910 was a billboard, but 2070 was a hologram  Weapons, same stats, different aesthetics, sounds, experiences  And the story, characters were the exact same, but the skins glitches between the two  Firstly, is this even possible to have something in a GTA vibe, but have it glitch in and out of art styles  Secondly, I'm sure this isn't a new idea, if you can recommend any precedents that would be greatly appreciated  Thirdly, cool right?  Thank you
of5vn4,Revamp some good Oldies,So, hear me out on this. Maybe not a lot of you know these games, but Armored Core and Chrome Hounds were my two favorite games before I started playing on PS4. However now they aren't really...enjoyable. What if someone could modernize the graphics into 4k, add more story, rework the customization and make, in essence, a second Armored Core. Same thing goes for Chrome Hounds. I thought the customization and different parts you could get and the enemies you fought in Chrome Hounds, as a experimental military vehicle, was outstanding.   Please, someone get this to the nearest game designer and have them look at it. Besides titalfall, there weren't very many mech games that I seem to enjoy. Nothing like those.
of6kl7,A mix between a card game an RPG and a shooting game(very weird combo I know),so basically id imagine it playing something like legends of Runteria or Yugioh with card effects spells and all that but whenever you're in combat like the duel phase in Yugioh it turns into a shooter/RPG with cards now having different effects and having there own special gun and abilities and so on you kill someone in duel phase their card gets discarded. that's as much as a got right now. (have no idea how you would pull it off thou)
ofb5d0,New Stealth Game Idea,What about a stealth game where your character has chronic diarrhea? You’d have to get to a bathroom every so often or risk getting caught. Sometimes if you don’t it make just be a fart so you can chance it, other times you will submerge the whole floor.
ofbztb,I need help on deciding what to do for my game,So I don’t know if this belongs here, and I don’t know if this’ll break any rules but basically, without spoiling too much, my friends and I (mostly me) have been making this F.E.A.R. inspired game for years. Technically it started development before I played F.E.A.R. but right now I have the story finalized and the environments planned. The problem is is I’m not sure what to do gameplay wise. I’m using the FPS Creator engine (grew up using it and basically know it’s ins and outs, plus I started developing this idea on it back when I was in middle school) and after constant revisions and remakes, I have two ideas.   The first idea is a more old school corridor shooter with fairly basic AI; this will work best for my friends who are not avid PC gamers or gamers in general. The second idea is more of a mix of F.E.A.R. 2 and Call of Duty, with fast paced battles but slow atmospheric buildup, and more intelligent AI. Here’s the problem I have though. This idea I have, is to make an anthology horror franchise, with this first (or second if you want to count my demo as the first part) game being an homage to F.E.A.R., if by nothing else concept alone. I’ve already made several ideas for other games in this universe, but I can’t decide between the more classic feel or the more modern feel.   The classic feel would work but I’m not sure it would be as much fun to a more hardcore audience. I’m not going to lie and say my atmospheric buildup is great and the voice acting is spectacular, both are, I’ll admit, not as good as they could be, although one can be excused because the voice actors are all graduated high school students. The casual shooter is finished, for the most part. A few bugs here and there that I’ll have to work out and I’ll have to place the voice acting in once I’ve finished mixing it. But it’s basically done.   As for the more modern game, this would be a lot of fun, especially with this AI designed for this type of gameplay. The problem is is I’d have to completely redo the entire game in order for this work. The AI is similar to that of F.E.A.R., and needs more of an open area to work properly. Old school corridor shooter wouldn’t work well. And here’s the other problem. FPS Creators memory issues. The program was created in 2005 for windows XP and it still has the XP mindset, meaning that a game using a lot of fancy shaders, graphics and scripting would take up a lot of space of the limited memory in the program. And I’m afraid if I do this idea, I’ll have to cut MASSIVE parts of the game for the sake of finishing it, in addition to completely remaking it. I’m afraid I bit off more than I can chew with the story (which isn’t anything super crazy but has a TON of working parts.)   I’m not sure what to do. Make the weaker game with a better story or make a better game with a more compressed story? I’ve been working on this concept since 2010, I’ve poured my heart and soul into it. I’ve rewritten the story hundreds of times, remade the game dozens of times, and restarted so many times, I have all these different anthology stories and games mostly finished, all of which are revolving around this first title that’s supposed to be the Gateway hub of the entire universe. I mean I’ve made concepts for prequel adventures, sequels, spin offs, etc. all of which are incorporating all these ideas I have. But I want people to enjoy the first title, the gateway to this world. And I’m not sure what to do. Throw all my best mechanics out from the get go or start simple and have the game improve gradually as I finalize them. Please give me some advice because this is super exhausting to think about.
ofc218,Are business simulation games dead?,Just wondering why there are not many business simulation games. Or are there?
ofch20,A hack and slash game where the enemies are based off of folklore or mythological creatures from different counties,Im surprised no one has done this yet. There are a decent amount of countries with their own unique monsters or creatures. Like Japanese,Polynesian, African etc.  My idea for the game is a God of War(specifically the originals)/spiderman ps4 style game. You play as a rookie Hunter who is looking for a job or jobs that can help get him to the top.   In the game you will have two types of weapons a melee and ranged weapon. Melee is the weapon you will be using most and each melee weapon will have its own special power and unique moves. You will also be able to upgrade your melee weapon and gain new moves or special attacks. Ranged weapons are used to get in extra damage and extend combos. Each ranged weapon will have ammo  that will slowly replenish when you run out or when your not using it. Every weapon has its own special attacks that uses energy. You can get more energy for each enemy you kill. The less damage a special attack does the less energy it takes and the more damage it does the more energy it takes.  Most enemies will have their own weaknesses which you can exploit to take them down quicker. For example an enemy may be weak to a specific weapon you have or take more damage from behind.  That is all i have for this idea feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below.
ofckic,FPS Survival Farm!,This literally just popped into my head, no additional thought has gone into it, don't ask for more specifics because I ain't got em'!  It's a survival game where the player is left in a deserted area, maybe a foreign planet, maybe earth after an apocalypse, doesn't matter. The goal is to set up and defend a farm from any number of threats. The thing is, all you have is a handful of mixed ammunition and some vegetable seeds to start, but if you plant the bullets you'll literally grow a gun that fires them. You can harvest more "Seeds" from the plants as well to keep your clips full, and depending on the level of care/skill at growing things the player has, the better weapons they grow. The same applies to food grown, the better your farming skills, the better crops you grow.

ofjq14,Criminal mastermind management game,I don't know if this kind of game exist, but this is a cool idea, and it doesn't need amazing graphims, it's a management game, not the next AAA.  You play a criminal mastermind (very similar to Bain in the Payday serie).    You have to build a network of criminals, indic, mole, shop.   I don't know if it's better to manage one gang and make them to the top or to help a lot of different criminals (up to you).     The game is composed of two main phase:   \-The plan : you get infos, insiders, plans of the area, everything that can help you to think about a way to complete the heist.   \-The execution: you help the gang during the heist: give them info on the patrol units, hack computer and door/device. You also synchronise the crew with the extraction unit or the insiders in order to optimize the heist.  &amp;#x200B;  While doing all of this, you have to keep a eye on your identity to keep it unknown by everyone, but also known in the criminal band to get more jobs.     Your goal is to make more and more money, since each heist cost money to prepare: you have to pay all the operation members, buy some gun or devices, pay corrupted cops to keep it low...  This is the core gameplay, but this can be dig in: for exemple, you have to search more info on your insiders and gang members to prevent any problem (link with the police or dangerous rivality).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry for bad english, not my native language, blabla, you know it already.
ofkx5l,2D Ping-Pong game with telekinesis,Visually, as a comparison, would be like Tug the Table, and the idea would be to use telekinesis to throw the Ping-Pong ball to the other side, it would just need to hit the wall, the ceiling or the floor, since most of the time it would be floating thanks to the telekinesis.  The way the telekinesis I think would work is like Ki energy in Dragon Ball games, the more energy you have, the stronger your telekinesis is, but the more time you're wasting to move the Ping-Pong ball.  I can see at first a game mode where you can play 1v1 against the computer, or another player, the rest is up for debate.  Also, I put Intermediate because it's between Intermediate and Experienced in my opinion.

ofq41l,Top Down Co-op Sci Fi Survival Game, Colony Builder, Interplanetary Travel Encounters,Over the past year I have been working on a game that I'd like to share with everyone to get some feedback. Here is the gist of the game:  * You and your friends start on a planet where you mine/harvest local resources in order start a colony. The towns on the planet will have willing workers that you can recruit to join your party to speed up resource collection and will eventually stay in your colony as you construct buildings that require workers to operate, such as farms and factories. * Soon you will be able to build a starship that will be your primary form of travel to other planets. Just like your colony on the planet, you'll be able to customize your starship to fit your needs. With a starship now available, you'll be able to travel to other planets with unique and rare resources to further expand your colony. * During your travel to these planets, you and the companions you choose to bring with you will encounter other ships, pirates, blackholes, etc. As every planet has new resources, different challenges, and different races and species, so too will the expansiveness of space. * As you progress you will be able to start building your own droids for your colony and starship, as well as building a small force that you can use to rid planets of hostile foes so that you can colonize the planet for yourself and expand your kingdom.  I'm open to any thoughts and/or feedback!

ofsk2p,Roguelike where you are a soul collector,In this roguelike, you visit the depths of hell to collect demons' souls.   Each floor is a circular arena with a soul collector in the center. You must explore the arena, kill the enemies, collect their soul and take it back to the central collector.  You must reach a minimum of souls before leaving the floor. There'll be "vending machines" at some points of the arena, where you can exchange demon's organs for weapons, health, abilities, etc.  But it's not enough to just kill demons. After a demon dies, its soul will try to escape from you until it vanishes. You must use your hook to grab and collect them.

oftria,Dr Robitnic Prequel Idea,Would love a prequel with him as a young boy. At first you don’t know it’s egg man and the whole time you are thinking, “wait, how is this a sonic game?” No cartoonish animorph villain (kind of) and no main animorph characters. His name is Robert  (Bobby) Sputnik in this prequel (Robotnic). He gets lost in the woods one day and is very spooked by some animals. He heads into a cave for shelter and enters a hidden lab and finds Dr. Mammalian (Who is a blue great ape). In the background you see some hedgehog shaped things in a tank (silhouette of them anyways). At first he seems harmless and asks you to fetch him a few things in return you can stay there and eat. He eventually gifts you with a mech of sorts with a suction. He asks to to capture some small creatures for his project as he wants to help save them by, “making them just a bit smarter”. Then you have to defeated rare and dangerous animals, at one point you even have to defeat a dragon like creature, but only have time to take one of his horns as it fell off during the battle. Towards the end of the game you realize that he was turning the animals into chaos emeralds, however as a by product of this some of the energy in creating these emeralds leaked into one of the animal pens and transformed them into the animorphs we know and recognize. Eventually you have to defeat Dr. Mammalian, but after because you helped him to begin with the animorphs lock you away. This can be tweaked but I feel is a solid idea.
ofvcqd,Aftermath of the zombie apocalypse,The game would take place a year after the zombie apocalypse and life is going back to normal. The countries of the world all decided to find and punish Parasol Inc, who are responsible for causing the outbreak. You would play as Richard Themis, who was a former War Crime prosecutor before the outbreak. You would have to investigate different areas of the world to collect evidence and witnesses to build your case against Parasol Inc. Then you would have to prove their guilt during the trial.  There would be a dialogue tree for when you are questioning witnesses which impact your relationship with them depending on your choices. The player would also get to choose which evidence and which witnesses they would bring to trial.  (This is my first time posting, so please tell me if I did anything wrong)
ofx2ed,Two part dinosaur game!,This has been a dream game of mine to make for a while, but I have no programming skills, so I share it here for any and everyone!  Anyway, so the first part is a park builder, you set up facilities for guests and staff, habitats for dinosaurs, change the terrain, ect, normal stuff right?  Well, part two, either when your ready or after X time passes, disaster strikes, everything goes wrong, and the game goes into first person mode, and now you are an employee/guest of the park, and you must escape either to the docks or a helicopter pad, while evading dinosaurs that have escaped their enclosures and are hunting you, or just so happen to be in your way. Of course you can pick up tools, items, and weapons along the way, but you'll have a hard time killing the bigger dinos even with the best weapons, cause ya know, it's not a dino hunting game, it's a dino escape game(killing a big dino can be a difficult achievement sort of thing).   And, maybe the ability to build a park and post it to challenge others to complete it? Maybe groups can escape together? Maybe extra challenges, like collecting dinosaur DNA samples from a lab before you escape?  Lots of options with this, I think this would be a kickass game!
ofxdij,DarkHearts,The year is 20XX and humanity is on the brink, being under siege by Darklings, once innocent humans and creatures, corrupted and mangled by a living parasite called Dojinshii, nothing can harm these creatures aside from an ancient alloy which has given birth to ancient weapons forged many eons ago, however humans have recently discovered how to forge this alloy themselves, though it's not enough. A mad scientist comes up with a solution, a being spliced from different DNA, and infused with this virus to be a darkling himself, able to harm these creatures without such weapons... You are this warrior, born to end the destruction and despair the Darklings have wrought.  The game itself: imagine a side scrolling slasher/bullet hell, where you gain upgrades and unlock new abilities which you can use to combo enemies, including bosses. But you yourself can also be comboed, enemies and bosses can do combos on you and normal enemies can work together to make your life hell, where a single hit can turn half health, into death(depending on difficulty). So let me go over the finer points.  Player main abilities: The player has access to a small amount of basic punches but, most of your things will actually come from proper energy and sword use as your punches and kicks come from the same button your sword is, lemme go over them quickly, both your energy and sword have a bar, the more you use your sword the more it depletes, once empty you can't use your sword at all as you can't summon it at all as it appears and dissapears from your hands rather than staying there permanently, instead you punch, but it regenerates when the sword isn't used, energy is slightly different, same as the sword, all energy moved deplete the bar, however unlike the swords passive restoration, the energy required a moment of respite to Regen. Since it's a bullet hell with many things on the screen at once at times, a dodge is essential, and the dodge can be upgraded and changed, but the basic is, you hold a direction and hit the button, and you dash that direction, in the beginning before upgraded, you dash then can't move in the air, you just have your dash momentum and gravity, once you hit the ground you have a split second of recovery, this can be removed through upgrades, which is gonna be heaven becuase of the bosses, of course if you ground dash, where you never leave the ground, then there is no recovery at all, aside from a moment where you can't dash again, however this moment isnt terribly long, about .80 seconds, or so, I haven't gotten the exact numbers, but it isn't terribly long.  Combo System: Not fully fleshed out but the majority is here, depending on your difficulty, combos are gonna be longer or shorter, we'll take Hard as the example here though, with differences being told at the end.... So bosses have something called Hitstun Decay, where the longer the combo goes on the less your hits actually stun them allowing follow ups, however some bosses the combo system works differently, on big bodies, you can't move them with your attacks, meaning some combos won't work at all, but they still get stunned from hits, just not as much as smaller bodies, meaning you'll not be comboing these bosses as long or often, smaller human sized bosses can be moved from your attacks, meaning you can take advantage of certain moves to get a full longer more damaging combos, however special super powered human sized bosses have a move that gets them out of combos instantly, usually damaging the player if they are too close, punishing the player if they get too greedy. The player can also be comboed, however the player also has this Hitstun Decay, though reduced on hard, meaning you'll be comboed longer, on Nightmare(unlockable after beating the game on hard) there is no hitstun decay for you.   Combo Structure: the combo system is mostly free form, with few absolutes, but there are a few rules that the player must adhere to, let's go over what can cancel into what, but first...  Moves: There are four main types of moves, when talking about combos, you have your basic moves, which would be just pressing attack, these can then be canceled on hit into special moves or dash, special moves are slower and longer recovery moves that require more input, for example spinning slash, a move where if the player is in the air will spin like a ball and have their sword out, much like zeros spinny slash, would require something like 216 attack, or something, these special moves can be canceled into dash as long as they hit, into other special moves, or into super moves, these are usually super slow but super damaging moves that have a lot of recovery, usually your combo ender, however later upgrades allow you to cancel your super so it never comes out but still takes the bar cost, allowing longer combos. Now onto the rules, you only get to use a special twice per combo, and dash cancels take energy, and a hit super almost never allows follow up, I say this because of a theory combo that may be cool, where you use one of the sword moves, where you throw your sword and it spins in place for a moment damaging whatever close to or on top of it, and then you super and becuase of the sword you can keep it going due to the hit stun, idk though. Each move affects the hitstun decay differently, basic attacks affect it the least, removing the least amount of stun frames on hit, specials are the next in line, removing more stun frames on hit than basic attacks, dash attacks are next, then finally supers, removing the most hits, multi hit moves while always removing more stun frames than single hit moves, don't count every hit, meaning for example a single hit from say a single hit special could for example remove 1 frame of hitstun, the 3 hit special would only remove 2 frames. Those aren't the absolute numbers just an example, some multi hit moves would count all hits, such as a three hit combo from the sword coming from a single sword special input would count all three hits, but a flurry slash comprising of say 5 hits wouldn't count each hit. Speaking of, energy attacks both have less hitstun and remove less stun frame, while sword attacks have more hitstun and remove more.stun frames. You are allowed 1 hard launch after any moves that hard launch instead soft launch, what's the difference? Well a hard launch sends the enemy up into the air a short distance and they don't recover until they hit the ground, while a soft launch they can recover before they land.  1 hard bounce, after all bounces become a soft bounce, a Hard Bounce is the same as hard launch only they bounce a very short distance off the ground and don't recover until they hit the ground again, while a soft bounce they can recover at any time during the bounce. One final thing to note, while not a set in stone rule, more of a possible rule, is damage decay, the longer the combo goes on and following the same rules as hitstun, each move would do less and less damage, but this rule is a possible rule I haven't decided if it would actually be in the game.   Level design: Taking heavy inspiration from games like MegaMan, the level design would follow suit, being a 2D side scroller with platforming and stage dangers on some, while they can be taken slow, they should be designed so an expirenced player can just smoothly and effectively speed run right through, as an ideal play of a stage would be fast planned but often dashes through picking and choosing what enemy you'll take down, but a player could also player would have the option of taking down every enemy and methodically making their way through, with little softlocks based on speed, but rewards the player on making it through certain things quickly, such as making more progress or gaining access to a spot otherwise closed off, such as an upgrade or shortcut and such.   Special Moves: Now you may be thinking, "Calan, the special moves are quarter circles... So.... Are there a limited number of them? Or can you pick and choose?" The answer is you can pick and choose, let me go over inputs, which I'm not opposed to changing,  S=sword, E= energy, X= input exists for both 214X, 236X, 412X, 632X, 236S+E(this is your super)  Meaning all in all you have up to 4 special moves each, im open to changes to this tbh and there are more special moves than 8, meaning you can pick and choose your playstyle and combos. With certain once complimenting eachother more than others. But in the end free form and open ended. So what do you have to pick from? Not all are in my head, but I'll go over a few that I have fleshed out let's start with sword 1: a three hit combo, with the last one being slow but heavy hitting, with the last hit causing a Hard Bounce, can only be done on the ground. 2:A ground slam, where the sword is slammed point down into the ground, if done in the air you shoot down, on impact with the ground it creates a shockwave around the impact, which if on the ground does a Hard Launch, while the aerial version causes a soft bounce. 3: A forward lunge, doing up to 3 hits as it goes forward, in the air this move can be directed but not in a 360°, more of a 100° with the center being straight down. 4: A rising slash doing up to 4 hits, on whiff or if not canceled you don't recover until you hit the ground. 5: A single slash sending a projectile going across the ground. 6: An aerial spinning slash doing a max of 6 hits, if all 6 hits connect it does a Hard Bounce, but only on the first time, every other time it doesn't bounce at all, however if you hold down after the input you spin the other way, useful for if you are falling down you can keep the enemy from going down faster than you.  7: A sword throw, which has many versions, you are only allowed one of these  Basic: You throw your sword and it dissapears shortly after thrown.  Spinning Boomerang: it is thrown spinning, making it's way forward then coming back, your momentum is stopped as you stand there when it's thrown, if done in the air you float there while it does it's thing, it also pulls enemies toward it, meaning while it's coming back it pulls them towards you.   Hibernating Spin: the blade is thrown spinning, travels a short distance then stays there floating in that spot for a short time, then dissapears.  Teleportation Blade: You throw the blade straight and teleport to it on hit.  Energy Specials: 1: A basic beam, hitting a max of 5 times, in the air it can be angled downwards, but only at a fixed angle. 2: You slam your hand into the ground and it causes a pillar of energy to rise up instantly from the ground in front of you, on hit it causes a Hard Launch. 3: a slow moving ball of energy that tracks to the nearest enemy. 4: you cause an explosion of energy around you, hitting every where close to you. 5: a barrier that lives for a very short time, but when you are hit, it drains energy bar rather than health, has big startup cost, and massive damage hits break it, stunning you for a short time and depleting your entire energy bar. 6: a quick but short dash backwards, it has no invinc  Now onto basic moves, as for the sword if you keep mashing the sword button you'll do a little combo that can be changed and upgraded depending on how you want it to act, but basic no upgrades or changes you do a three hit combo, left horizontal sword slash, right horizontal sword slash, into a bit of a slower over head slash. Now each of the three hits can be changed and you can even add more hits, for example that second slash could instead be changed to a forward stab, or a shorter range angled shoulder to knee kind of slash, the last hit can be a upward slash, or a forward lunge, etc etc... The energy is a bit different, hitting your energy button fires a energy ball which travels along decently fast, you can spam it to throw up to three quickly without upgrades, this is mostly your ranged attack, and combo fodder.  So how exactly do you get these upgrades and stuff, well easy, Darkness. With every Darkling you kill you gain a currency called Darkness, which you can spend to upgrade things like your dash, to dash farther or shorter distance, dash more in a row, change and upgrade your sword skills, increase your max energy, max health, max sword bar etc. Upgrade and receive new specials, gain new supers etc. But you can only do these things at base, where there's even a test dummy that can move and such so you can practice combos, it even shows how much damage each move does when you hit it.  Enemy Moves: certain enemy Moves will have an alert before they happen, for example if a boss decides to do a forward dashing lunge, a ! will appear in front of them, with 2 lines above and below it showing their trajectory, it'll also beep 3 times with them attacking on the fourth beat, if they do multiple lunges from this single lunge, the rest will also do the alert, but only beep twice, with them attacking on the third beat, if they do it fast enough it may not alert you at all, for example, a full screen beam coming from one end and going to the other, which appears filling the space between both points instantly, then extremely quickly after another appears just a tiny distance above it, and it keeps going very quickly sweeping across from the bottom of the screen to the top very quickly, only the first attack will have any kind of alert.  I have more info but this post is rather long and it took me quite some time to write it. I thank you for reading this whole thing, it's more of an idea, I'm absolutely open to suggestions and special designs and such things if you have any questions please feel free to ask, I'm sure I forgot things or didn't say things clearly.
ofzr5e,A RPG with choosable turns,I have no idea how to simplify the title properly.  You know how rpgs are either the strongest/fastest go first or the party goes first then the enemy? Well, here's an that puts that on its head.  It works like this: when you enter a battle. You have to not only select the attack you want to use but when to use it. Lets give an example(i would attach an image but idk how to)  The party of 4 enter a battle with 1 enemy. After choosing an attack, a box appears showing 5 boxes. The box in the center has a skull, representing the enemy, while others are empty. Select a box and circle will appear in it. The colour of the circle will represent who is going.  The idea is to strategize the way to fight. If you want the enemy to die fast, put the 2 strongest up first. There is more to this idea, like status effects that mess with the boxes or bosses and multiple enemies using more than one box but i just want to type this down.
og25x7,VR Record App,It would be so cool to have a native music player app that allows you to view visualizers in VR, maybe even have a mode where you can make physical objects out of albums in the game world (e.g simulating a vinyl record and being able to create a VR vinyl shelf
og2ier,I want to resurrect a Amiga era forgotten game on Android. I have coded a working prototype with libGDX.,The game is suitable for micro transacitons.  It is a puzzle game with levels so it is okay to use ads between levels. The game is 2D (duh...).  Also it is addictive as fu\*k, I used to forget to eat when I was playing.  It can be coded by one person but I lack the time and mad skillz to make a game with appeal.   I am 36 and have PhD on Mech. Eng.  I need a team, one man army or cash to make this game.   I am based in turkey a programmer works for 1000 euros tops so when I say cash its a measly amount for europeans.  Serious entrepreneurs please contact me for details, thanx.
og2rke,How would you create a fighting game like Street Fighter, but for more than 2 players at once?,You could obviously zoom out and just let them battle but I dont think that it would look that great, and also with 3 players it would feel a bit unfair.  Any ideas?
og2zmh,Here is an idea for an infinite dream game, IMHO.,Ever since I saw AI dungeon, an idea began to form on my mind and is now a lot more mature, it just lacked the environment, until I saw Valheim.  Lets take a game like Valheim, it uses procedural generation to make great environments with a flora system that can also produce occasional mineral rocks, land marks and the odd structures.  develop that to make occasional villages and roads to connect those places, populate the place with more sentient actors, like other characters.  This is just the beginning, lets add some need and goal-based quest system.  I mean the whole logic part of the game can be placed upon the goal system.  When you or any other actor gets hungry, then the goal to eat food pops into your/their goal list, as opposed to quest list.  If you/them have any food-like item then you/they can eat and fulfill the goal. If not, then another goal is generated: Acquire food.  === === === === === === === === === === ===  What now? Well, if it is the player's goal, then it is shown in a list of goals, needed to be fulfilled, sorted by importance level and the availability of the prerequisites.  If it is an actor's goal, then if the actor is marked as important, i.e. involved in your previous adventures, then the goal can be translated to a sentence like: "***The farmer is hungry***", and be fed to a system like AI dungeon, pun intended.  If the actor is not important then a routine previous output for the goal is taken and interpreted for the actor to perform.  The AI would interpret the input with previous entries and come out with a result.  Then this result is interpreted by the game engine, and it would weed out the too bizarre, unmanageable and bonked outputs and select the ones that it can manage to interpret and convert into the games actual environment.  It can add new goals to track, spawn new required actors for the roles or select the suitable available ones,  spawn or select needed items, and place them in the places defined by the AI output doing what was specified there with the generated or picked items.  New goals and events are fed into the AI as they are generated, outside of the AI system, by other systems, or player actions.  Something like: "***The player picks the picket of the guard.***"  That particular guard can be previously generated by the landscape generation system on the entrance of a castle, or be generated by the AI system on an output like: "***A guard appears and blocks the way of our group of adventurers.***"  There can be a grouping system that adds a collection of actors or items and gives them a containing name.  For instance the instant that an NPC accepts your offer to join you in your adventure, a group is generated and named, and you join that named group.  Well, back to pick pocketing action, the items in the pocket can be generated, when the guard is generated, but if the AI results in: "***And finds a rare item.***", we can wait for more output from the AI to define the item and generate that particular item to place in the list, or choose from a list of predefined rare items, suitable to be in the pocket of a guard.  Or maybe the output would be like: "***The guard notices the player's action and steps back and draws a laser cannon from his pocket and attacks the player***", which the interpretation system then replace the laser cannon with the weapon pre-generated when the guard was generated, or pick from a list of more suitable weapons for the environment and the guard status.  The system can understand the step back and attack actions and perform them correctly.  === === === === === === === === === === ===  When you begin a conversation with an NPC, the goal system can step in and generate some predefined text for your choice, sorted by the importance of their particular goal.  So there can be conversation entries available to choose from, like this:  Do you know where can I find a job, I need the money.  This goal can be the result of your being hungry, and lacking food, so you searched for it and found some, but the owner was a merchant and asked you for money in exchange, so the goal to make some money was generated, which resulted in that particular conversation entry.  There can be other entries like:  Where can I find Sir Drakulz?  If you select this entry, it is converted to: ***"Where can I find Sir Drakulz?", the player ask the clerk.***  Then it is fed to AI system and the output can be something like: "***He is probably in the castle.***"  You know the castle was generated by the environment system, and was fed into the AI system as soon as you were in it's sphere of influence, just as any other place, landmark, actor,  and item.  Something like: "***There is a castle nearby.***"  Some less important entities, like a chair nearby is only fed when you touch or use it, and something like a ***sword*** on the table, can replace the ***blaster*** when interpreted by the system.  Some feeds are global and define the global environment and theme, and can be chosen as you initiate your game, others are fed as needed.  === === === === === === === === === === ===  There is no difference between the player and any other actor, so when a goal is added to you, you can follow them by their importance level, and when a goal is added to another actor, they would follow them by their importance level.  The goals can add conversation entries to any actor, and they will use them, and the AI system would interpret them a come up with results for the talking party.  The goal system rules the game, so when some events happen or when you hear an answer to your spoken words, maybe a goal can be offered to you to add to the current list.  So when someone answers: "***Maybe Sir Drakulz knows about the lost piece.***", the goal to find him is offered to you, by the UI, like: "***Do you want to find Sir Drakulz?***", and if you accept, the goal is added to your list.  IMHO, this combination of AI Dungeon, Valheim, and a need and goal based internal logic and conversation system can make the ultimate infinite life ruining game of them all.  These are just ideas for any interested party, as I don't have the time and means to make such a game, and I don't claim any rights on the ideas.  Just want to inspire some party to make such a game.  By the way, I have thought a lot about these ideas and have some nice solutions on how to implement them, and can offer them if anyone is interested.  Like how to keep track of the entities that we feed into the AI system, and if it would be better to use Sims style conversation grunts, and the like.
og6jxc,Marble Racing Game,Last year I was astonished about those Pandemic Marble Olympics from Jelle's Marble Runs' channel on YouTube, principally the marble racing laps. And I was wondering about a First-person-3D-multiplayer-racing-game with marbles instead cars, where players can customize it. I think this game in comic ways, like Fall Guys. Cheerful, colorful and funny. But I have to admit it's kinda boring to just watch your marble losing a race again and again. I like the concept more than the game LOL. What you guys think?
og8guz,Augmented reality board games with online multiplayer.,AR board games that can be played anywhere with anyone at anytime. Availiable for mobile devices and possible plans for independent standalone AR glasses. Currently developing a prototype game with plans for multiple game boards implemented in future. The first game is similar to "Risk" in a more post apocalyptic future. Instead of physical tokens, gameboard and  dice, 3D models are used in thier place. 3d dice roll mechanics with battle scenes of firefights and explosions. Selectable menus that float in the physical world.  Reach out with your hand and select the different territories to interact with, whether its for information, deploying troops or attacking. Play with up to 6 friends worldwide.....All input is welcome, Thank you.
og8ul1,Survival Open world Monster game like spore but Better,Okay, what if there was a game like the spore creature part but you make more realistic monsters to roam and survive a large open world map. Could maybe be both an MMO or single player. On the MMO you can find other monsters (other players) and team up or fight them. You could make monster's more adapted to specific biomes such as deep sea would use bioluminescence to capture prey but also have a disadvantage not being able to see well. Or monster's that can fly and perch on mountains but are slower when walking or running. The longer you survive the more likely you are to evolve and become more powerful. There is probably better mechanics than what I could think of but I still think it is cool.
og9k3i,Subnautica, but underground.,I've had this bizarre dream, and I wanted to share it because it actually felt like a decent idea.  The game would begin with a tutorial where you play as a miner. Basically, a mining expedition stumbled into a massive cavern, and you are the only person who escaped, warning that you've found hell, and that you've seen the devil himself.  As it turns out, they've stumbled into an enormous cave system that's been isolated for hundreds of millions of years, and is now inhabited by monstrous descendants of Cambrian fauna. The true protagonist is a scientist who was sent with a team of other explorers for a rescue mission to try and locate the missing people, but he gets isolated for some reason.  He would have to survive in a massive cavern, with plenty of critters running around.  You  only have a pick, a flashlight and some rope. You could use the rope to climb, the flashlight to see, and the pick to climb/fight.  There were trilopites, isopods, crabs and glowing bats running around as harmless creatures.   Then there were these giant lobster-like creatures that didn't have claws, but instead had fingered arms. They'd try to grab your arm with their hands, and bite you. You could break their arms with the pickaxe though.  Also remember there being a giant crab that looked like a boulder, and its shell was too thick for you to hurt with a pick, so you had to push it off a cliff.   And if I recall correctly, there was some spider-like creature that clung on the ceiling, and would fall onto you.  Another creature looked like a giant snail with glowing antennae. You could pick it up and use it like a flashlight, or you could throw it at the lobsters which would eat it instead of you.  I also vaguely remember a run-down elevator you could fix for fast travel.  And lastly, the cave had multiple different biomes, like an underground cliffside, and underground sea with glowing coral, mushroom forests, crystal valleys, and claustrophobic insect infested corridors.
ogbjm4,Kill rivals or recruit them to your party.,The game's combat is a simplistic souls-like, you attack to do damage, guard to neutralize damage, dodge to throw of the tracking of your enemy's attacks, and parry to set them up for a critical hit. By collecting things either hidden in each level or dropped from slain enemies, you can upgrade your character's primary capabilities.  At certain intervals in the game, you'll come across bosses that are humanoid, or rivals, that once defeated will prompt you two choices: kill them and take their primary ability as a special ability, or spare them and recruit them to your party that can be switched out in each level.  You'd need their primary ability to transcend certain obstacles and reach optional collectables in previous levels, but each character has a distinctive fighting style very different from the MC's such as having ranged attacks, attacks that deal multiple hits per use, attacks that are the most effective and efficient against certain types of enemies, or attacks ideal for crowd control.
ogc57p,Pizza delivery without a car but with a skateboard and a harpoon gun,In the near future gas and cars are very expensive and you are only a pizza delivery guy. The good news if you have a skateboard and a electromagnetic harpoon gun.  You need to deliver pizzas around the town and you get larger tips for how fast you can get to the house. There are cars driving around the town(in game driven by people but in reality AI driven) so you hop on your skate board and shoot a passing car. If you hit the car you are pulled by a rope to follow the car. If the car makes a turn you can reel in the rope to cut down on the whip effect but if you are too close and the car stops you may slam into the back of it(and die), if you are too far back you may hit a wall.  You can disengage the harpoon gun and shoot another car(if you want to go straight and the car is making a turn or to stop to make the delivery). There are no set paths to go, just get from the pizza shop to the delivery address but cars are driving on their own paths so if you hang onto the wrong car you can go in the wrong direction.  As you earn tip money you can buy upgraded skateboards, better harpoon guns etc.   What do you think? Would this game be fun? How complex would the AI programming be and would it be feasible to have all these cars driving on AI routines to make the city look lived in on modern hardware?
ogcch3,You play through someone's life, non linearly,**Central Idea*****:*** The time in the player character's life is navigable. Instead of playing through the adventure or story in a linearly order, the player could select any chapter in their life to jump to and play through. Maybe the player starts with the beginning, infancy, or instead right before they die. This is more of a thought experiment than just a "for fun" game, but hopefully it would be enjoyable to play and get the player to think a little.   **Gameplay:** Although the idea is non-linear time, that doesn't actually speak for gameplay. That's because you can probably do this within many genres. When you go to a chapter in time, you always start in the same place, and I'm assuming a fairly linear level. That's because in my opinion, an open world game would probably be too complex for both the developer and player.   A ***story game***, in the form of a visual novel or puzzle game would be feasible and could make a lot of sense. You could require knowledge or abilities from the future to make events in the past much easier, or possible at all. Certain encounters wouldn't make much sense until you go back in time and get an "ah ha" moment. Past puzzles could or would set up future puzzles, maybe even change them based on the players actions.   Or instead a ***metroidvania***. You would unlock abilities at different chapters of time that would, in typical metroidvania fashion, make other areas easier to access. Although there could be hard locks to certain level, soft locks might make more sense. A new player would need X ability to get past a stage, but an experienced player could do without. A twist on the typical metroidvania idea, instead of navigating a place, you are navigating time.      **Last thoughts:** The story could have an event (almost randomly placed in their life) that would act as the final boss which explains the time travel ability, but I don't know if that would fit. Also there would be trippy questions like if there is any free will because each chapter is always the same, and how can you do an event from the past to get to the future if you needed the future to do it. Maybe some one has beat me to this idea, and if so id love to see it. Let me know if you have any ideas or questions!
ogen12,Does anyone think that a battle royale mode with a closing zombie horde could computably ever even work?,The idea of a giant apocalyptic horde closing in from all around sounds spectacular and fun, get to close to the edge and it can warp the circle or move it faster. Dead players would become player controlled feral zombies with different stages of composition.     But, I feel like computers nowadays right now probably wouldnt be able to handle so many mass entities on screen, bcse its got to be large enough that players can just use explosives and fight their way out. Thoughts?
ogfnz2,You knows whats missing from battle royales, spectator influence.,The Hunger Games movies and books suck, personal opinion, but the spectator or sponsors aspect they have is something the gamemode could really use and quite frankly needs. Especially since so many games encourage and sometimes force playing in pairs or a group, and we all know theyre more fun with friends. Teammates could give temporary intel or buffs, the entire dead player base could vote on map influences or give random attributes to the players like low gravity or big heads.     I feel like this would make the gamemode in general more exciting for everyone, so you dont have to be good to play long, and are otherwise just waiting between finding matches.
oggijh,A Game where Jimmy (GTA 5) Gets revenge.,At the end of game in GTA 5 you get a option To kill Michael, Trevor, Or Deathwish. I picked the best option Deathwish. So in this universe Franklin for some reason kills Michael. Then the story’s about Jimmy actually starting to get a good life. Then his dad is murdered. So he trains and does other things to kill Franklin and he has to fight Franklin’s Gang. Which I think Ballas
ogp7ok,I need ideas for a warioware type game,I LOVE the warioware series, and i'm thinking of making a game in it's rapid-fire-microgame style, but i need ideas for the microgames. I'm sorting them into 8 categories:  Anything goes: the miscellaneous category, i need some really easy ones (like your mom/sister) for the intro stage, then some hard ones (that's what s/he said!) For the last stage  Fantasy: stuff with magic/strange creatures and a lack of technology.  Arcade: the equivalent of the 9-volt stage, these are refrences to anything from the arcades, preferably namco, atari/midway, sega, and those non-digital arcade games like skee-ball or wack a mole. I KNOW the boss game is going to be dance dance revolution.  The movies: basically every bad parody movie ever as a stage, these games should parody famous movie scenes.  Sports: speaks for itself. Don't be afraid to use some more obscure sports for these.  Old-school viral videos: the kinds of things that were popular on early YouTube. Fails, lame dancing, and pets reign supreme in this stage.  That's life: stuff that can be recreated with things you have at home. The things that dr crygor's stages in warioware usually were about.  At work: games involving people's occupations, both blue and white collar. This could range anywhere between a plumber unclogging a toilet to paper basketball in office job.  Sci-fi: the same as fantasy, but with technology instead of magic, and usually involving outer space.  Anything that can be fit into 4 or 8 seconds is acceptable, but longer games can be used for the "boss" games.  Not to mention the arrange modes.
ogprjl,Self regulating difficulty mechanic in Time Traveling mech game.,This game is about piloting a far future mech in a near future conflict. The main gimmick is that the time travel agency the player works for has a limited amount of mass it can send back in time for the entire campaign. The campaign will consist of a series of missions,  beating one will unlock the next. However the mass of the mech used to beat that mission will be subtracted from the total mass available for the entire campaign. Since this game is about time travel, the player can replay any mission they have already beaten and choose a different mech. Should they beat it with a lighter mech, that playthrough becomes the "canon" timeline and the mass freed up can go back to the campaign pool for future missions.  This will allow the player to explore the level on "easy mode," driving the biggest most destructive mech, then switch out to smaller weaker mechs to increase the challenge. Completing the level with lighter mechs will allow the heavier mechs to be used in later missions. Hard core completionists can try to beat the game with mass to spare, while more casual gamers can still experience most of the content with a mechanic to encourage them to try a harder difficulty.  Also if you want to blow off some steam after a hard day of work you can stomp the biggest mech through the level that is giving you trouble for grins and giggles.
ogqzhw,Space 4X game where speed of light actually matters,Hi all. Here's a little idea that came to my mind recently. I might attempt to prototype it one day, but feel free to use it if you find it interesting.   The game is set either in a tiny galaxy or a star cluster \~50 light-years in diameter. You start as a ruler of a single star system which is your capital/seat of power. The setting is hard sci-fi. Each turn takes a year of real time. During each turn, you have a pool of orders which you can spend to perform your usual 4X actions (build structures and fleets, do research, send exploration missions).   The main mechanic of the game is that the universal speed limit works just like in our universe. Your basic ships travel at 50% speed of light. Information travels by radio waves at light speed. If you have a colony that is 4 light-years away from your capital system and you order them to build something, this order will reach them in 4 turns. Same with the feedback information. If something happens in this colony, you will only learn about it after 4 turns have passed.  I imagine this mechanic would lead to some interesting scenarios. A colony's gone black. Maybe it's just a busted transmitter and they'll resume the communication next turn? Or maybe something bad happened and you need to send a rescue mission? Or maybe send a fleet, just to be sure? Perhaps another colony has been attacked by an alien force. Does it make sense to send a fleet to that system? Could they still be holding with their meager garrison? Or should we write them off as a casuality and use this fleet to mount a defense elsewhere? You could also recruit governors of different types and send them across the stars to make some decisions in your stead, but of course, they wouldn't be 100% reliable (some could be corrupt or incompetent and in the worst case, they might want to rebel and secede from your empire).  Basically, the incomplete/delayed information would work as a kind of a fog-of-war and put a brake on the snowball effect which is prevalent in this kind of games.   The main purpose of the technology tree in this game would be less about who can develop the best lasers/shields, and more about finding better ways to manage a vast, interstellar empire (FTL communications, warp gates, efficient bureaucracy, and so on).
ogr6q9,Opinion on my survival game idea,Hello guys I have a survival game idea and I need your honest opinion on it.   It will be based on the gameplay of unturned and tarkov.   But instead of having zombies or scavs there is demons, imps and other hell creatures. Based on that the game would feature some “magical” things like special weapons but it is still in reflection.   Please be honest and share your ideas 😄
ogrzdj,Randomly generated Zelda,Zelda, but terrain and locations are random, but still for example mountain buildings are on mountains. An Idea for a game that will be different every time. (Except for saves)
oguqce,Short film/Skit Party Game,If I was to describe this game in as little words as possible, it would be: charades except teams act out prompts in game with characters, props and sets, which is recorded with an in-game perspective camera, then shown to other players at the end of the round for voting. You must rank the other teams skits and they get points accordingly.   Further explanation:   The teams are separated from one another before they get their prompts. Players would be given a selection of props, characters, and sets to choose from after they have their prompt. Then each player can take on different roles to act in the skit. One player controls the camera, which is an actual in game object (although they can set it up to point in a fixed position and remotely toggle recording on and off if they want to act as well). Whenever the camera is recording, players in game mics are also recorded. Each team gets a short set amount of time to design their skit and then act it out and record it, the time constraint should be tight to force impromptu and silly ideas. Teams can give their skits titles, and also add basic effects if they like. Once the timer is up, the teams are reconnected in a movie theater setting, and one after another, the teams skits play on the screen. Once all skits have played, you rank them in order of preference, and points are awarded accordingly.      Alternative ideas:   \- some teams might not get good characters, props, or sets for the prompt they are given, and so it might be better if each team actually creates the prompt and selects the props etc. for another team. For example, my team could give another team a dog and human character, some bowls, a house set etc. and the prompt "if dogs had humans as pets, instead of the other way around".   \- teams could also be rated on the quality of prompt they came up with and the props etc. that they paired with it.  Style:   I was thinking an isometric 3d topdown or third person with art similar to overcooked. You would of course have the ability to change to the in game camera's perspective to see exactly what it is seeing/recording though.  I'm also welcome to any variations of this idea that make it more fun, simpler, or more feasible to create. Thanks.
ogwjbs,Cool Core mechanics for a 3D platformer,Do any of you have some cool mechanics for 3d collect a thon platformers that are as versatile as cappy from mario odyssey(has to be completely original) somthing that can be chained with the movement. Something that allows players to move around skillfully using a mechanic. Look at this video if u want to know what im talking about: https://youtu.be/z_KVEjhT4wQ. I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the "core" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic. I really want players to utilize the move set of this hypothetical game, so use this video if you want to know what I’m talking about. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rlmVxrq-3Go. ONE MORE THING, it has to be a ranged attack, but not too far from the player, because jumping on an enemy is hard.
ogwmvy,Suggestions for my game.,[removed]
ogxugl,Transmission speed between units,What kind of games/puzzles can be created based on the core mechanic that transmission speed between units is a factor?  My inspiration for this idea is my memory of getting a faster modem back in the BBS days.  Not only did things suddenly draw on your screen a lot faster but you were that much more capable of actually doing things  Other than a long download we don't really think of time for units to communicate as being important anymore, since it's usually assumed to be instant, but the idea of faster transmission speeds between units enabling further game progress could yield some interesting game mechanics
